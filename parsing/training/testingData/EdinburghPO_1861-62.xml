The Proprietors of The EDrNreimGH and Leith Post-Office Directory have again the honour of submitting to the Public another Volume of the Publication, being the Fifty-sixth ; and they avail themselves of the opportunity to express their grateful thanks for the kind support and patronage which they have received, and trust that their exertions to make the Publication both correct and useful will be followed by a continuance of the favour of the Public. To the Map, which was issued for the first time last Year, has been added a Scale shewing the Num- ber of Seconds the Eeport of the Time-gun takes to travel to any part of Edinburgh and Leith. In the Street Directory, a Number has been attached to the name of each street, &amp;c., indicating the Registration District of Births, Deaths, and Mar- riages, to which it belongs ; by which, on turning to the List given at ^127, the name and address of the Registrar can at once be ascertained. The List of Public Offices has been entirely remodelled and enlarged ; and the Bank Directory has been much enlarged and improved. An Engraving of the Proposed New Post-Office, by Messrs W. &amp; A. K. Johnston, has been added. It is hoped that these alterations will add to the usefulness of the Publication.

Then, opposite to the Month, at the foot of the Right-hand Table, will be found a corresponding Letter, over which are placed the Days of the Month and "^Veek for that Month (distinguishing the Sundays by a different type). Each Blank Space in the Left-hand Table shows the year following to be Leap Tear ; and as every Leap Tear has two Dominical Letters, the Letter above the Blank Space must be used for January and February in every Leap Teax, and for the other month*; use the Letters belonging to the respective Tears.

The following is from schedule of 23 Vict. c. 15, under Bill of Exchange, Draft, or Order : — " All Bills, Drafts, or Orders, for the pay- ment by any banker or person acting as a banker, of any sum of money, though not made payable to the bearer or to order, and whether delivered to the payee or not ; and all Writings or Docu- ments, entitling or intended to entitle any person whatever to the payment from or by any banker, or person acting as a banker, of any sum of money, whe- ther the person to whom payment is to be made, shall be named or designated therein or not, or whether the same shall be delivered to him or not, shall respectively be deemed to be bills, drafts, or orders for the payment of money chargeable with Stamp duty, as if the same had been made payable to bearer or to order. Provided always, that any one Document or Writing, although directing the payment of several sums of money to different persons, shall be chargeable with Stamp duty, as one order only." Draft or Order, Writing or Document, for the payment, or for entitling any person to the payment, by or through any banker, of any simi of money, sent or delivered to the banker and not to the person to whom payment is to be made, or any person on his behalf, to be held not to have been and not to be charge- able with any higher Stamp duty than oyie penny, although payable at any time after date. Duty may be denoted by adhesive stamp, to be cancelled as in the case of a draft on demand. 23 &amp; 24 Vict. c. Ill, § 17. Exemptions. — Any draft, or order drawn by any banker upon any other banker, not payable to bearer or 'to order, a?id used solely for tlie purpose of settling or clear- ing any account between siich bankers.

III. c. 30, and the Acts continuing the same, which make bills, &amp;c., above 20,s. and under £5, if not drawn in a particular way, invalid, and those below 20s., abso- lutely invalid, and not to the Scotch Act to the like effect, 8 &amp; 9 Vict. c. 38, § 16 and 17,— provided that the said Act and the continuing Acts should be re- pealed, in so far as regards drafts on bankers for money held for the use of the drawer. And the Act 23 &amp; 24 Vict. c._ 111, § 19, now provides generally, without special reference to either the English or Scotch Acts, that draft on a banker who shall hona fide hold money to or for the use of the party, payable to bearer or order on demand, of any sum less than 20s. shall be lawful. Do both the above provisions apply to Scot- land, or only the latter ? The Act 8 &amp; 9 Vict. c. 38, § 20, provides that that Act shall not prohibit draft on a person's own banker for the payment of money to the use of such person. N.B.— The duty on drafts or orders may be impressed on the paper, or an ad- hesive stamp may be afhxed. — 16 &amp; 17 Vict. c. 59, § 3.

The same duty as on an Inland Bill of Exchange, for the payment of money otherwise than on demand. Note. — The word endorsed is held by the Board of Inland Revenue to have no practicable effect. See Times, 20th and 22d April 1860. N.B. — The duties on Foreign Bills, drawn out of the United Kingdom, are to he. denoted by adhesive stamps. The holder to affix the adhesive stamp if one not on it before he negotiate it, and cancel the stamp by writing his name or the name of his firm, and the date on it, 17 &amp; 18 Vict. c. 83, § 3. The Act 23 Vict. c. 15, § 12, provides that the party paying the bUl, shall, when he does so, Avrite the word "paid" upon the .stamp. The amount of duty on adhesive stamps is impressed on two parts. The Board of Inland Revenue recommend that the cancellation should be on one of the parts, and the other left legible. If a Foreign BiU payable abroad, and as to which the provision " drawn in sets of thi-ee or more" apply, shall be drawn in a single bill, the duty will be the same as on an Inland Bill, and if in a set of two, the duty on each will be the same as on an Inland Bill. This is in accord- ance with the opinion of the Board of Inland Revenue, (see North British Do.ily Mail, 3d November 1854.) But the Board have given an opinion that a Fo- reign Bill drawn abroad and payable in this covmtry in duplicate or triplicate only represents one transaction, and is liable to the duty on one Inland BUI of the same amount, — that is, if one of the parts have the full duty, the others may be imstamped, (see Times, 6th November 1854.) The schedule of the act does not provide for such a biU being drawn in sets.

Mandate. See Proxy. Marriage Contract. The leading head under which marriage contracts are charge- able is " Settlement." By the statutory note under this head, it is provided that instruments, containing settlements of lands or other property, or other matter or thing, besides the settlement of money or stock, shall be chargeable with duty in respect of such, as if contained in a sepa- rate deed. A marriage contract may therefore be liable to a number of different duties. If definite and certain sums, and shares of stocks, are settled so as an in- terest to any extent shall be given, which shall certainly take effect, and not be altogether contingent, these are liable to the ad valorem Settlement Duty. If an annuity is provided to the widows or others, such is liable to Bond of Annuity Stamp Duty. Obligations to pay sums to widow, such as for mournings, are liable to ad valorem Bond Duty. All settlements of property, or other matters not liable to specific duty, will be covered by one general deed duty, over and above the other duties. An obligation by the bus- band, to pay sums to the trustees for tho children, if any, would be liable to the Bond Duty, not Settlement Duty, being contingent. Mortgages, Heritable Bonds, &amp;c.

According to decisions, a simple acknow- ledgment of a sum of money in loan, or of the correctness of a debt, or of a de- posit of money, is not liable to stamp duty, either as a receipt or promissory note. The judges held it essential to render a receipt liable to duty that some- thing formerly due had been discharged. On this principle a receipt for a sum of money as a donation to a rehgious or charitable purpose, not being an}i;hing formerly due, would not be liable. The Board of Inland Revenue have intimated that they are to regard such receipts as exempted. Among the exemptions from receipt duty are — Receipts written on projnissori/ notes, bills, drafts, or orders for the pai/ment of money, duly stamped. Receipts v&amp;gt;ritten on any bond, inortgage, or other security, or any convexjance, deed, or instrument whatever, didy stamped, achioiv- ledging the receipt of the consideration money therein expressed, or the receipt of any priiicipal money, interest, or annuity thereby secured.

If the deceased person died domiciled in Scotland, it shall be competent to in- clude in the Inventory of the pereonal estate in Scotland, the personal estate in England and Ireland. The estate in England and Ireland shall be separately stated in the Inventorj", and the Inven- tory shall be stamped with a duty cor- responding to the entii'e value of the estate situated within the United King- dom. If confirmation be required, the domicile must be proved, and the Com- missary must find it to be in Scotland.

It is therefore still competent to pay Inventory Duty on the estate situated in Scotland, and Probate or Administration liuty in respect of the estate in England and Ireland. In the case of a person dying domiciled furth of the United Kingdom having personal estate situated in Scotland, this mode of paying the duty must be followed, as in that case there is no provision for pay- ment of Stamp Duty, in respect of the personal estate in England or Ireland, on the Inventory, or obtaining confirma- tion in respect thereof. Additional Inventory — Corrective Inventory. If there be any omission in the Inventory inferring payment of further duty, an additional Inventory of such is required to be exhibited by 48 Geo. III. c. 149, § 38 ; and § 40 provides that the same shall aLso specify the amount or value of the estate and effects of the same person comprised in the former Inven- tory. By 16 and 17 Vict. c. 59, § 8, such additional Inventory shall be chargeable ordy with such amount of Stamp Duty as, together with the Stamp Duty chai'ged upon the former duly stamped Inven- tory of the estate and effects of the same deceased person, shall make up the full amount of Stamp Duty, in respect of the total amoimt of all the estate and effects of the deceased specified in. the said additional and any such former In- ventory. If the estate shall be over- estimated, or if something shall be im- properly included in the Inventory, an Inventory on a stamp corresponding to the ascertained value must be exhibited, and the original inventory wiU be allow- ed on affidavit as a spoUed stamp, within six months after the recording of the second Inventory.

II. MOXEY SECURED ON HERITAGE, &amp;C. The Act 23 Vict. c. 15, § 6, (3d April 1860), declared that money secm-ed on herit- able property in Scotland, and money secured by Scotch bonds in favour of heirs and assignees, excluding executors, should be chargeable with Inventory, Probate, or Administration Duty.</page><page objectIdentifierValue="83533325" pageOrder="55">STAMP DUTIES, ETC. 47 The Act 23 and 24 Vict. c. 80, was passed to regulate the levying and collection of the said duty. Section 1 gives a de- scription of the property which shall be liable to Inventory Duty under the Act of 23 Vict. c. 15, and section 8 further explains what shall be subject to duty. Section 9 of the Act 23 and 24 Vict. c. 80, repeals the Act 23 Vict. c. 15, § 6, in so far as regards Probate and Administration Duty being charge- able in respect of the property, so that now in all circumstances such property is liable to Inventory Duty. Section 1 is in these terms : — Description of property liable to Duty, and com7nencement of Duty. " All money secured on heritable property in Scotland, and all money secured by Scottish bonds and other instruments, excluding executors, and all money se- cured by Scottish bonds and other instru- ments, the rights to which shall be taken excluding executors, constituting the succession, or part of the succession, of any person who shall have died on or after the 3d day of Ap7-il in the year 1860, shall be liable to Inventory Duty under the said recited Act." There are two modes of paying the duty provided for— 23 and 24 Vict. c. 80, §§ 3 and 4 : — Two modes of paying the Duty. 1. By a " Special Inventory" of the pro- perty, to be lodged with the Solicitor of Inland Revenue at Echnburgh, (a form of which, with relative oath, is given in the schedule to the Act,) stamped according to the amount of property contained in it. The Inventory Stamp shall be tes- tate or intestate according as the Stamp on the Inventory of the personal estate shall denote the testate or intestate rate of duty. 2. By adding the amount of the property to the Inventory of the personal estate, and paying Stamp Duty upon the aggre- gate amount. This second mode will generally be the most advantageous for the tax payer ; and will be followed when the interest in the heritable and moveable estate is the same, or when the heir and executor can make an arrangement as to the pay- ment of the duty. As to both modes of paying the duty, it is declared that the duty is ultimately to be borne by the parties proportionally according to their interests in the property. Value to be at the date of tlie oath to the Inventory, and Inventory to itwlude proceeds to that time. The 5th section of 23 and 24 Vict. c. 80, provides, that the Inventory Duty shall be payable on the property made liable by the Acts referred to, according to the value of such property at the time the Inventory containing it shall he sworn to, including the proceeds accrued there- on down to that time. Act retrospective as to time of valuing Personal Estate. It will be observed that the Inventory Duty on money secured on heritage, &amp;c., is limited to such property constituting the succession of a person who shall have died on or after the 3d April 1860 —23 and 24 Vict. c. 80, § 1 ; but the pro- vision for valuing property at the date of the afl&amp;davit to the Inventory, and including the proceeds down to that time, is retrospective and universal in its operation, applying to all Inventories sworn to on or after the passing of the Act (6th August 1860) without regard to the date of death.

(If confirmation be required, That confirmation of tlve said personal estate is required in favour of the deponent and the said .) All which is truth, as the deponent shall answer to God. Opinioit. t We are of opinion that it is sufficient in the Inventory given up of the Estate of a person deceased for confirmation, to set forth the value of the Estate as at the date when the Inventory is given up, and that it is not also necessary to set forth the value as at the date of death. We further think, that the statutory form of confirmation contained in Schedule E of the Act 21 and 22 Vict. c. 56, must be modified, in order to be in accordance with the still more recent Statute, 23 and 24 Vict. c. 80, by leaving out the words " at the time of his death."

N.B. — Printed forms and regulations re- garding all the succession duties will be obtained gratis, on application at the Inland Revenue OfHce, Edinburgh ; and at the offices of the distributors of stamps in the country. Succession Duty. — Tlie duty commences on the death of persons dying after the 19th May 1853, and seems to be imposed on all property, both heritable and move- able, passing by death, not liable to the duty on legacies and successions to per- sonal estate upon intestacy — the duty im- posed by the Legacy Duty Acts. The duty on heritable property is charged -on the annual value, after allowance of the neces- sary outgoings (§ 22), as an annuity for the life of the successor (§21,) which is to be valued by tables annexed to the act. Personal Property is liable to duty accord- ing to the value of the succession ; and money charged on heritage — heritable securities — is chargeable as personality (§!•) Rates of Succession Duty. Lineal issue, or lineal ancestor of the pre- decessor, — £\ per cent. Brothers and sisters of the predecessor and their descendants, — £3 per cent. Brothers and sisters of the father or mother of the predecessor and their descendants, — £5 per cent. Brothers and sisters of the grandfather or gi'andmother of the predecessor and their descendants, — £6 per cent. Any other person, — £10 per cent. The husband or wife of the predecesssor is not chargeable with duty (§ 18,) and if the successor's husband or wife shall be of nearer consanguinity than the suc- cessor, duty is payable according to such nearer relationship (§ 11.) The following are also exemptions from the succession duty. 1. Successions from the same predecessor, passing on any death, not amounting in principal value to £100 (§ 18.) 2. Any succession of less value than £20 in the whole (ib.) 3. Legacies and personal property charged with legacy duty, in respect of the same acquisition (ib.) Note. — The collection of the succession duty forms a branch of the business of the Legacy Duty Department of the Inland Revenue. Forms of the ac- counts may be obtained at the Legacy Duty Office, Edinburgh, and at the offices of the distributors of stamps in the country. Return of Inventory Duty. The inventory duty and probate and ad- ministration duty are paid on the whole personal property, without deduction of debts ; but the Act 5 and 6 Vict. c. 79, § 23, provides for a return being given on proof of the constitution and pay- ment of the debts. This return must be claimed within three years ; but the time will be prolonged on application to the Board of Inland Revenue. A return of the duty paid on heritable securities may also be made in certain circum- stances. See 23 and 24 Vict. c. 80, § 4 and 6. Legacy-duty, On Legacies, Pcesidues, t&amp;c. Duty per ct.

If the legatee's husband or wife is of nearer consanguinity than the legatee, duty is payable accord- ing to such nearer relationship. (1(3 and 17 Vict. c. 51, § 11.) This duty is payable for every legacy out of the personal or moveable estate, or out of or charged upon the real or heritable estate of the deceased, or out of any moneys to arise by the sale, mortgage, or other disposition of the deceased's real or heritable estate, or any part there- of : Also for the clear residue (after deducting debts, funeral expenses, lega- cies, and other charges first payable thereout) of the personal or moveable estate, whether the title to such residue shall accrue by virtue of any testamen- tary disposition, or upon a partial or total intestacy : And also for the clear residue of the moneys to arise from the sale, mortgage, or other disposition of any real or heritable estate, directed to ' be sold, mortgaged, or otherwise dis- posed of by any will or testamentary instrument. (55 Geo. III. c. 184, sch. part III.) Annuities commencing to be payable on the death of persons dying after 19th May 1853, are valued for legacy duty according to tables annexed to the Suc- cession Duty Act, 16 and 17 Vict. c. 51 ; and Annuities commencing to be pay- able previous to that date, by the Tables annexed to the Legacy Duty Act 36 Geo.

The Solicitor's Office, No. 5 in the Inland Revenue Office, is open for the allow- ance of spoiled stamps every Tuesday and Thursday, from 12 noon to 2 p.m. The distributors of stamps at the follow- ing places also receive spoiled stamps for allowance : Aberdeen, Ajt, Banff, Cupar-Fife, Dumfries, Dundee, Elgin, Forfar, Glasgow, Greenock, Inverness, Perth, and Wick. A supply of forms of affidavits is kept by the solicitor and the above distributors, and claimants may attend at the Solici- toi-'s Office, and have the affidavits filled up and taken ; or they may get copies of the forms, and take the oath before a Justice of the Peace, and afterward.s lodge the affidavits and the .stamps with any of the above officers. If the claim be admitted, a ticket is issued, stating that application is to be made for the new stamps after Thm-sday se'ennight, and within six weeks from the date of the ticket. If not made within that time the claim will be forfeited. The stamps, if belonging to parties resident in Edinburgh, or within ten miles there- of, must be presented for allowance within six months after being signed in the case of executed instruments, and six months after being spoiled in the case of unexecuted instruments. If beyond that distance, six months in the foi-mer, and twelve months in the latter case. Bills and notes delivered to imyees, or negotiated or issued in any way, and bills accepted or tendered for accept- ance, cannot be exchanged unless a new bill be produced, in all respects the same, excepting the correction of the error. As to the exchange of sea j^olicies of in- sm'ance, see 54 Geo. III. cap. 133. Unsigned instruments are allowed if inad- vertently spoiled. Signed, if void in law from the beginning ; from error or mis- take, unfit for the purj^ose originally intended ; from death or refusal to sign, of any person whose signature is neces- sary ; from the want of the signature of some material and necessary party ; from refusal to act under, or from non- acceptance — they .shall be unfit for or fail of the purpose intended ; or if the transaction be carried through by an- other instrument duly stamped. — See 53 Geo. III. cap. 108. In the case of transfers of stock signed by the seller alone, and other instruments if by one party, new deeds require to be produced to the proper officer of stamps, who, as to transfers, is instructed to certify in what i^articulai's they difter from those spoiled. Stamps of a difierent description may be obtained for any stamp spoiled if it be of the value of £G or ujjwards. Applica- tion for this purpose to the Commis- sioners of Inland Revenue .should be lodged with the affidavit. Tire com- missioners, by 3d and 4th Will. IV. cap. 97, § 19, may, if in their discretion they</page><page objectIdentifierValue="83533400" pageOrder="61">STAMP DUTIES, ETC. 53 think fit, refund, in money, the amount of spoiled stamps. They are also autho- rised to repay the amount of stamps for which the possessor has no im- mediate use, if applied foi- within three months after being purchased. In both cases is deducted the per centage allowed by law on the pm'chase of stamps. STAMPING DEEDS AFTER BEING SIGNED. Beyond Twelve Months. — The duty or de- ficiency of diity, shall be due and pay- able to her Majesty, and also the penalty of ^10. The deed will only be stamped on payment of the whole or (as the case may be) the deficiency of the stamp duty remaining payable on it, and over and above such duty, a penalty of i£lO ; and if the whole amount of said duty or deficiency shall exceed iilO, then, in addition to said duty and penalty, there shall be paid, by way of additional jjenalty, interest on the duty or deficiency at the rate of 5 per cent. from the date or first signing of the deed ; but such interest shall not ex- ceed the amount of the said duty or deficiency of duty. Within Ttvelve Months. — If the deed shall be brought to the Commissioners of Inland Revenue within twelve months after the first signing or executing, in oi'der to be stamped, it may be stamped without payment of the penalty, or on payment only of a portion thereof, pro- vided it shall be proved to the satisfac- tion of the Commissioners that the deed was not duly stamped previously to being signed, by reason of accident, mistake, inadvertency, or urgent neces- sity, and without any wilful design to evade or delay the payment of duty. — 13 and 14 Vict. c. 97, § 12. Abroad. — If the deed shaU be executed by any party abroad, it may be stamped without any penalty, if brought to be so within two calendar months from the time of being received in the kingdom, upon proof of the facts to the satisfac- tion of the Conmiissioners.— 13 and 14 Vict. c. 97, § 13. N.B. — Instruments are received at the Soli- citor's Olfice, Inland Revenue, Waterloo Place, Edinburgh, to be stamped, if within two months of the first date (the solicitor may, in certain circumstances, receive them within two months of the last date), on payment of the duty: if beyond that date, on payment of the duty and penalty.

The opinion of the Commissioners of In- land Revenue as to the duty to which a deed, whether previously stamped or otherwise, is chargeable, may be obtained on the deed being presented at their office (Edinburgh) and a fee of 10s. paid. The duty or insufiicient duty which the Commissioners may assess, and the pen- alty, if any, being paid, they shall stamj:) the deed with the duty so paid, and thereupon, and also in the case of the deed being jireviously sufficiently stamp- ed, shall also impress the deed with a particular stamp to be provided for the purpose. The deed shall then be re- ceived in evidence notwithstanding any objection to it as insufficiently stamped. The provision does not apply to bonds or mortgages for unlimited amounts, nor instruments after being signed, prohi- bited from being stamped. The opinion of the Commissioners may be appealed against to the Court of Exchequer at Westminster, on the Stamp duties as- sessed being paid, and 40s. for costs being deposited. (13 and 14 Vict. c. 97, § 14 and 15.) The Commissioners may also adjudge on deeds not liable to any stamp duty ; and if any duty is assessed the party may appeal. (16 and 17 Vict, c. 59, § 13.)

GENERAL POST-OFFICE, EDINBURGH. Postmaster-General for the United Kingdom, EIGHT HONOURABLE LORD STANLEY OF ALDERLEY. i.-RATES OF POSTAGE. Inland Letters. The rate of postage on all inland letters is regulated by weiglit, irrespective of distance ; and ig as follows : — If paid in advance. Letter weighing not more than half-an-ounce Id. „ „ more than half-an-ounce but not exceeding one ounce 2d. „ „ more than one ounce but not exceeding two ounces . 4d. „ „ more than two ounces but not exceeding three ounces 6d, and so on ; twopence being charged for every additional ounce. Unpaid Letters. Except on re-directed letters, the postage, if not paid in advance, is double the foregoing; and if the payment in advance be insufficient, double the deficiency must be charged. An inland letter, for example, weighing more than half an ounce, and not exceeding one ounce, if bearing a penny stamp only, must, on deUverj', be charged twopence. The unpaid additional postage on re-directed letters, hovrever, is not doubled, beini; the same as if such postage were prepaid. Unless thre** quarters, at least, of the postage of a letter weighing more than 4 oz. be prepaid, the letter is not forwarded. Colonial and Foreign Letters. The rates of postage on letters to foreign countries and the colonies are entered in the Table of Foreign and Colonial Postage at page 471. Addresses to the Queen and Petitions to Parliament. Petitions and Addresses to Her Majesty, forwarded direct, are exempt from postage; and such petitions and addresses, as also petitions to either House of Parliament, if sent to a member of either House, are likewise exempt, provided they do not weigh more than two pounds, and are without covers, or in covers open at the sides. No letter or other enclosure, however, must be inserted ; and if one be found, such enclosure, unless it bear the proper number of postage stamps, is charged as an unpaid letter. Newspapers and other periodical Publications bearing the Newspaper Stamp. All periodical publications, including newspapers published in the United Eingdom, at intervals not exceeding thirty-one days, and which bear an impressed stamp or stamps denoting the stamp duty (of the kind formerly confined chiefly to newspapers), may be transmitted and re-transmitted through the post within the United Eingdom free from postage under the following regulations, viz.: — 1. They are subject to the same restrictions with regard to the number of sheets and super</page><page objectIdentifierValue="83538460" pageOrder="473">POSTAGE DIRECTORY — RATES. ficial extent as were formerly applicable only to newspapers properly so called, restrictions are shewn in the following Table : — _461 These 1 Amount of Stamps impressed on the Publication. Maximum Number of Sheets. Maximum Superficial Extent of LetterpresB on One Side. One Penny Three Halfpence . . . Twopence Two Three Four 2295 inches, 3443 „ 4591 „ 2. No publication, or portion thereof, can pass through the post, unless the impressed stamp which it lx;ars be at least a stamp of the value of one penny. 3. The title and date of the publication must be printed at the top of every page. 4. The publication must be folded in such a manner, that the whole of the stamp or stamps, denoting the full duty, shall be exposed to view, and be distinctly visible on the outside, except that where there are more than two publications in the same cover, it will be considered sufficient if the stamps are so arranged that they can readily be examined. 5. It must not be printed on pasteboard or cardboard, or on two or more thicknesses of paper pasted together; nor must any pasteboard, cardboard, or such pasted paper be sent with it as a back or cover thereto, or otherwise. 6. It must be posted within fifteen days from the date of publication. 7. It must either have no cover, or a cover open at the ends. S. It must contain no enclosure. 9. It must have no -wi-iting or other mark thereon, but the name and address of the person to whom it is sent, nor anything on the cover but such name and address, the printed title of the publication, and the printed name and address of the publisher or vendor who sends it. Tims, if a newspaper, after having the address of one person written on it, be sent to another person, the first address must be cut off, otherwise the paper will be charged as an unpaid letter. 10. If the publication be addressed to any person within the free delivery of the place where it is posted, it becomes liable to a postage of one penny, wliich miist be prepaid by affixing a postage stamp. 11. When a newspaper, &amp;c., is so folded as not to expose the stamp or stamps, a postage of one penny is charged in addition to any other postage to which the publication, if properly folded, would have been liable; and if the newspaper, &amp;c., he addressed to any person witliin the free delivery of the place where it is posted, and do not bear a penny postage label, it will be charged twopence. In case of any other irregularity, the publication is dealt with in accordance with the regulations of the book post. 12. It is suggested that every publication should have a notice to purchasers conspicuously printed, pointing out the necessity of exposing the stamp or stamps to view whenever the publication is sent through the p&amp;gt;ost. 13. Stamped publications which have been issued more than fifteen days, can be forwarded within the United Kingdom and to most of the colonies under the regulations of the book post. Newspapers sent abroad must have been registered at the General Post-Office; and instead of requiring to have an impressed stamp, each newspaper, if sent to a British Colony, is liable to a postage of Id. (which must be pi-epaid by a postage label), together with an additional postage (as shewn in the Table of Colonial and Foreign Postage) when the newspaper has to pass through a foreign country. In the same table will be found the postage of newspapers sent to foreign countries. I Parliamentary Proceedings. Printed proceedings of the Imperial Parliament, sent without covers, or in covers open at the endS; may circulate within the United Kingdom at the following rates of postage : — Weighing not more than four ounces Id. ; „ more than four ounces but not exceeding eight ounces . . 2d. „ more than eight ounces but not exceeding twelve ounces . 3d, „ more than twelve ounces but not exceeding sixteen ounces . 4d. and so on ; one penny being charged for every additional four ounces.</page><page objectIdentifierValue="83538472" pageOrder="474">462 POSTAGE DIRECTORY RATES. Prepayment, when the circulation is within the United Kingdom, is optional ; and if it be made in part, the simple difference is only charged. The words Par. Pbo. should be invariably written of printed on the cover. To the British colonies and possessions in West Indies, Canada, Hong Kong, Ceylon, Malta, and Gibraltar, the rates chargeable on Votes and Proceedings are the same as printed books, and to certain other colonies, according to Inland Book-rate. Inland Book Post. At the following charges, and on the subjoined conditions, book packets may be Bent by the post to any place within the United Kingdom : — Weighing not more than four ounces Id. „ more than four ounces and not exceeding eight ounces . 2d. „ more than eight ounces and not exceeding sixteen ounces . 4d. „ more than one pound and not exceeding Ih pounds . . 6d. and so on ; 2d. being charged for every additional half-pound or any less weight. 1. The postage must be prepaid in full, by means of postage stamps affixed outside the packet or its cover. 2. Every packet muet be sent either without a cover, or in a cover open at the ends or sides. 3. A book packet may contain any number of separate books or other publications, prints, 1' or maps, and any quantity of paper, parchment, or vellum (to the exclusion, however, r of letters, whether sealed or open). And the books or other publications, prints, maps, ^ &amp;c., may be either printed, written, or plain, or any mixture of the three. Further, aU legitimate binding, mounting, or covering of a book, publication, &amp;c., or of a portion thereof, will be allowed, whether such binding, &amp;c., be loose or attached; as also rollers, in the case of prints or maps ; markers (whether of paper or otherwise), in the case of books; and, in short, whatever is necessary for the safe transmission of the packet, or usually appertains thereto, but no pattern.? or books of patterns can be admitted. 4. A book packet, whatever may be the postage paid thereon, mtist not contain any written letter, closed or open, or any enclosure sealed or otherwise closed against inspection. Entries, however, merely stating who sends the book, &amp;c., or to whom it is given, are not regarded as a letter, and may therefore be made. 5. No book packet can be received, if it exceeds two feet in length, width, or depth. 6. Any packet which shall not be open at the ends or sides, or shall have any written letter or any communication of the nature of a letter in it, or upon its cover, is charged with the "unpaid" or double letter postage. 7. If a packet be found to contain any letter, whether closed or open, or any enclosure sealed or otherwise closed against inspection, or any other unauthorised enclosure, the letter or enclosure is taken out and forwarded to the address on the packet, charged with the full postage, as an unpaid letter, together with an additional rate of Id. ; and the remainder of the packet, if duJy prepaid with stamps, is then forwarded to its address. 8. If a packet be not sufficiently prepaid with stamps, but nevertheless bear a stamp of the value of Id., it must be forwarded, charged vrith the deficient book postage, together with an additional rate of Id.; but any packet which shall bear no postage stamp is charged with the " unpaid " or double letter postage. 9. In every case in which the postage charged upon a packet under these regulationB would be greater than the letter rate, the latter postage is substituted. Colonial Book Post. At the following charges, and on the same conditions as the foregoing (except that no packet weigliing more than three pounds can be sent to the East Indies or to New South Wales, and that iiO book packet can be sent direct to any other part of the Gape Colony than Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, and ilossel Bay), book packets can be forwarded to even' Colony : — To India, Ceylon, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania (Van Diemen's Land), South Australia, Western Australia, New Zealand, Z^Iauritius, and Hong Kong, the charge is as follows : — Yia Southampton.

Bavaria, Greece, the Papal States, Switzerland, Syria, Tripoli, Tunis, Turkey and Egypt, and Wui-temberg, wlien spe.ciaU;/ directed to be foncarded " via France." On the class of Printed Papers, the rate paid in this country will cover the whole charge, either to the extreme frontier of France, or to the port of disembarkation, if they are con- veyed from France by one of the French Mediterranean Packets. Upon Newspapers addressed to the Ionian Islands sjjecially directed to be sent via France, and upon Newspapers for JMalta, specially directed to be sent " by French Packet via Marseilles," the same rates of Postage must also be paid in advance. The following is a list of the places in Turkey, Syria, and Egypt, at which France maintains Post- Offices, to all which the above rates apply, viz. : — Alexandria, Jaffa, Beyrout, Tripoli in Syria, Latakia, Alexandretta, Messina, Rhodes, Smyrna, Mitylene, Dardanelles, Gallipoli, and Constantinople. All Newspapers, to be forwarded at the lower of the two rates mentioned above, must be posted within Fifteen Days from the Date of Publication. There must be no other writing or marks upon the Newspapers or Printed Papers than the name and address of the person to whom they are sent, nor anything upon the cover but such name and address, the printed title of the papers, and the printed name and address of the publisher or vendor who sends them. If any of the above regulations be disregarded, or if the whole postage be not paid in advance, the Packets will either be detained, or forwarded charged as unpaid Letters. Newspapers addressed to the Mediterranean or the East Indies, and intended to be sent in the closed Mails by way of Marseilles, will continue liable to the existing regulations, including the present Rates of Postage. Sardinia, Tuscany, Spain, Portugal, &amp;c.

To Spain, the Balearic or Canary Islands, bound Books cannot be sent; neither can Prints, Music, Maps, nor Drawings, unless they form part of any publication included in a packet of printed papers. Printed papers, such as Periodicals, Sheets of Music, Catalogues, Prospectuses, and Notices of various kinds {InU no hound Boohs) may be sent to Portugal, Madeira, Azores, and Cape de Verde Islands by packet or private ship at Id. per ounce, or if sent via France and Spain, 2d. per ounce. Precautions against Fraud, &amp;c. The Head Postmaster who first recives a book-packet is required, whenever he has ground for suspecting an infringment of any of the above conditions, and occasionall}', even when there is no ground for suspicion, to open and examine the packet; and every book-packet which is not open at the ends or sides, or which exceeds two feet in length, width, or depth, or which has any letter or any communication of the nature of a letter written or printed in it or upon its cover, or which does not bear postage stamps equal to a single book-rate, is ordered to be sent up, with as little delay as possible, to the Returned Letter Branch of the Circulation Office in London, Dublin, or Edinburgh, as the case may be; but in the case of any other infringement of the regulations, the packet is dealt with by the Postmaster himself. To prevent obstacles to the regular transmission of letters, any Head Postmaster may, when necessary, delay forwarding a book-packet for a period not exceeding twenty-four hours beyond the ordinary time; and at Packet Offices the delay may, at the option of the Postmaster, be either for that period, or until the despatch of the mail next after that by which the book-packet ought other- wise to be forwarded. II.-REGISTRATION. By the prepayment of a fee of sixpence (which must be made, not in money, but by affixing stamps) any letter, &amp;c., pai/ing full letter-rate, may be registered to any place within the United Kingdom. Book-packets and newspapers can also be registered to the colonies. To foreign coun- tries letters only can be registered. Every letter to be registered should be presented at the Paid Letter Office, and a receipt obtained for it, and must on no account be dropped into the letter box. If a letter marked " Registered" be put in the letter box, it will be liable to a registration fee of Is., instead of the ordinary fee of 6d. The registration of a packet makes its transmission more secure, by rendering it practicable to trace it, when inland, from its receipt to its delivery ; and when foreign or colonial, if not to its delivery, at least to the port of despatch. The Post-Office does not guarantee the safe delivery of the letter, &amp;c., though the officers are of course responsible to the Postmaster-General, who will call to strict account any one neglecting his duty on this point, and, if his Lordship think proper, will require him to make good any less that may be sustained thereby. The latest time for posting registered letters is halfan-liour before the time for posting ordinary letters. Parliamentary Notices. Parliamentarj" notices may be forwarded through the post under the following regulations : — 1. The words " Parliamentary Notice" must be legibly printed on the face of the letter; and in order to secure the speedy return of anj- notices which may be undelivered, the name and address of the solicitor issuing such Parliamentary Notice should also be legibly printed or written on the face of the letter ; though this latter is not imperative. 2. These notices must be posted either at the General Post-Office, St Martin's-le-Grand, in London; the General Post-Office in Dublin; the General Post-Office in Edinburgh; or at the chief office at one or other of the following towns : — Liverpool Manchester Newcastle-upon-Tyne Norwich Shrewsbury. 3. All notices which, by the standing orders of either House of Parliament, are required to be served on or before the 15th December, must be posted on or before the 12th December, unless the 12th falls on a Sunday, when they must be posted not later than the 11th; but those notices which, by the same orders, may be served later than the 15th, may be posted after the 12th of that month. 4. The postages chargeable on these notices must be prepaid by stamps ; the registration fee of sixpence on each notice being paid in the usual manner. Aberdeen Exeter Athlone Glasgow Belfast Inverness Birmingham Leeds Bristol Lincoln Cork</page><page objectIdentifierValue="83538508" pageOrder="477">POSTAGE DIEECTORY — DELIVERY. 4G5 5. The notices must be posted at the Post-Office window, accompanied with duplicate lirit.i of the addresses ; the letters being arranged, for the convenience of comparison, in the order of the list. These lists are examined by the officer in attendance at the window ; and if each list correspond with the address, ho will sign and stamp every sheet of each li.-;t. One of the duplicate lists will then be returned to the person who brought the letters, and the other forwarded to the Secretary, General Post-Office, London. The hours for receiving both Parliamentary Notices and the undermentioned Voting Notices are the same as those for the registry of ordinary letters, unless the Parliamentary Notices be presented at such a time as to interfere with the ordinary duties of the office; in which case the Postmaster may appoint any other time within the next twenty-four hours for receiving the same ; providing that, when the notices are to be served on or before the 15th December, such arrangement do not delay the posting beyond the 12th. Whoever sends Parliamentary Notices should, if possible, arrange on the day before with the Postmaster as to the most convenient time for posting them, and state the probable number. On prepayment of the postage and of a registration fee of twopence, a notice bclono-ing to any one of the classes enumerated in the Act 6 Vict. c. 18 (relating to votes for members of Parliament) can be sent through the post with the securities for their safe delivery enjoined by law, provided it be brought duly directed, open and in duplicate, to a Postmaster of an office where Money-Orders are issued or paid. On receiving the notice, the Postmaster has to compare it with the duplicate ; and if the two agree, the latter will be stamped and returned to the bearer. Poll-books. ■\Vhen a poll-book is presented by any returning officer to be forwarded by post, the Postmaster is required to give to such officer an acknowledgment thereof in writing, stating therein the time when he received it. No registration fee is demanded for poll-books, and prepajTnent of the postage is optional, with- out regard to weight. ill-OELIVERY. Letter Carriers and Rural Messengers are prohibited, under pain of dismissal, from demanding or receiving any payment beyond the postage on letters, newspapers, &amp;c., v.iiich they are required to collect or deliver ; or from distributing any letters, newspapers, &amp;c., whether before beginning their rounds, whilst on their rounds, or after they may have completed them, except those which have been regidarly posted. Delivery at Window. Except where the number of daily deliveries is considerable, and where, therefore, the Surveyor considers such a regulation unnecessary, letters are delivered at the window after the arrival of every mail (within office hours) as soon as they can be sorted. In all eases, hoAvever, when there is a cor- responding deliveiy by Letter Carriers, the window delivery (whether to the holders of private bose.- or to the public generally) does not begin till the Letter Carriers have left the office, nor is it allowed in any way to delay the departure of the Letter Carriers. In order to prevent the additional trouble which is sometimes caused by letters being directed to a Post-Office, although for persons residing within a free delivery from such office, but who have no private box, a Postmaster is authorised, when such letters arrive by a mail for which there is a delivery from house to house, to refuse to deliver them at the window, and to send them out by the Letter Carriers, except letters addressed to the military in barracks. Private Boxes and Bags. Any person can have a private box who is willing to pay the appointed fee. Where this fee goes to the Revenue, it is fixed at one guinea per annum, to be paid in advance, and for a period of not less than a year ; and where it goes to the Postmaster, he may demand the same terms, though he may, at his option, take less. The same also, in most cases, are the terms for a private bag, except that in addition there is the cost of the bag itself, and a charge for conveyance, the maximum or the latter being half-a-guinea per annum if by a foot-messenger, and two guineas if by a mounted one. As the service of a private bag, however, may possibly delay the despatch of a general bag, fioae must be allowed without the permission of the Sui-veyor. 2 G</page><page objectIdentifierValue="83538520" pageOrder="478">466 POSTAGE DIRECTORY MONEY-ORDERS. IV.-POSTAGE STAMPS. Every Postmaster is required to liave on hand a suflScient stock of postage labels and penny stamped envelopes, and to sell them to the public at the following prices : — Stamped Labels. Penny Labels, Twopenny do., Fom-penny do.. Id. each. 2d. each. 4d. each. Sixpenny Labels, Shilling do.. Stamped Penny Envelopes. 12 to be sold for 8 6 Is. lid. Os. 9d.

Every Rural Messenger is authorised to sell postage stamps (including stamped envelopes) at the same prices at which Postmasters are empowered to sell them ; and is required, when he begins bis round, to have in his possession ready for sale at least five shillings' worth, of penny labels. Stamps. Prepayment of inland letters, &amp;c., must be by stamps, except at the Chief Post-Office, London. In the prepayment of books stamps only must be used ; but prepayment of letters to the colonies or places abroad, and in the case of letters pcsted in Malta, Gibraltar, Constantinople, the colonies in the West Indies, under the control of the Postmaster-General, may be made either in stamps or money. Except by soldiers and sailors in Her Majesty's service, British postage stamps are not available in the payment of letters, &amp;c., coming into the country. V.-MONEY-ORDERS. Requisition Forms for Money-Orders are sold at the rate of ten forms for one peimy, or of five or any smaller number of forms for a halfpenny. No order is to contain a fractional part of a penny. With the subjoined exceptions, no Money-Order can be issued unless the applicant furnish, m full, the surname and one Christian name, both of the remitter (the person who sends the order) and the payee (the person to whom the money is to be paid), together with the remitter's address ; and if the name of either party be tender^ at greater length, it must be received and advised accordingly. Particulars required for Money-Orders. 1, If the particulars be furnished in writing (whether by filling up the blanks in the printed form or whoUy in manuscript), it will not be necessary to give the Christian name in full ; it will be sufficient if the first letter be given. 2. If the remitter or payee be a peer or a bishop, his ordinary title is sufficient; and if a firm, the usual designation of such firm will suffice, except a company trading under a title which does not consist of the names of the parties composing it, as the " Carron Company," to which kind of company the above privilege does not extend. 8. When the remitter notifies in writing that the order is to be paid through a bank, it is left to his option to give or withhold the name of the payee. The issuing officer must in such case cross the order in the way that cheques are commonly crossed when they are to be paid through a bank. When application is made for a Money-Order payable in London, or any other town where there is a plurality of Money-Order Offices, the remitter should say at which of such offices he wishes it to be paid, otherwise the order can be paid at the Chief Office alone. It is not, however, incumbent on a Postmaster to supply such information relative to local or provincial offices. An order once issued cannot be cancelled ; and should repayment or transfer to a different office or alteration of name be required, the renaitter must apply to the Metropolitan Office.</page><page objectIdentifierValue="83538532" pageOrder="479">POSTA GE DIRECTORY M0NEY-0EDER3. 467 Payment of Money-Orders. When an order is presented for payment (otherwise than through a bank), the Postmaster haa first to see that the signature of the payee be as full as the name given in the advice, and be not in any way inconsistent therewith. He has then to call on the applicant to give the name of the remitter, and if the reply be correct, the order will be paid, unless the PoBtmaster have good reason for believing that the applicant for payment is neither the rightful claimant, nor deputed by him. When an order is paid through a bank, it is sufficient that it be receipted (without regard to any discrepancy between the signature and the name in the advice, or to whether the receipt is given by the payee himself or any other person), and that it be presented (crossed with the name of the receiving bank) by some person known to be in the employment of the bank. The holder of a Money-Order is always at liberty to direct, by crossing it, that the order be paid through a bank, even though its payment was not originally so restricted ; and when the order is thus crossed, the question put on the presentation of au ordinary Money-Order ia dispensed with. Lapsed and Void Orders. Money-Orders do not require a receipt stamp. Payment of an order must be obtained before the end of the second calendar month after that in which it was issued (for instance, if issued in January, it must be paid before the end of March), otherwise the order becomes lapsed, and a new order will be necessary, for which a second commis- sion will be charged. Any person presenting a lapsed order wiU be furnished with a copy of a printed notice headed " Lapsed Money-Orders," containing directions how to proceed. If the order be not paid before the end of the twelfth calendar month after that in which it was issued (for instance, if issued in January, and not paid before the end of next January), all claim to the money will be lost. No application can be entertainedfor compensation for alleged injury from the non-payment of a money-order at the expected time ; and after once paying a money-order, by whomsoever presented, the office is not liable to any further claim. Under no circumstances can pajonent of an order be demanded on the day of issue; and as respects orders granted at minor offices, time must be allowed for the advice to pass through the Metropolitan Office. In case of the miscarriage or loss of a money-order, a duplicate is granted on a written application (with the necessary particulars) to the Comptroller of the Money-Order Office of the kingdom where the original order was issued ; and by a similar application to the same officer, who (except as re- gards a temporary power to stop payment) can alone act in such cases, authority can be obtained to transfer the payment of an order from one office to another, or to stop payment, or to correct any error in the name of the remitter or payee, or to repay the money to the remitter. Every such ap- plication, however, must contain, in postage stamps, a second commission (namely, threepence for an order not exceeding £2, and sixpence for an order above that sum), though one commission wiU suffice even when, in the same application, more things than one, relating to the same order, are asked for ; as both the stoppage of payment and repayment to the remitter. Unless a sufficient reason be given for an exception, the application must be either from the remitter or payee. Whenever, on complaint being made, it is found that the necessity for an application entailing the pajTuent of a fresh commission is attributable to the Post-Office, the stamps transmitted in paymentof the com- mission wiU be returned ; and when it can be ascertained where the blame lies, the officer in fault will be required to pay the additional commission. A Postmaster is required to give information how to apply for a duplicate order, &amp;c., and must furnish the applicant with the prescribed form of application. Moreover, if payment of an order is refused in consequence of the replies to the questions respecting the remitter not corresponding with the entries in the advice, or of a difference in the name in the receipt, the Postmaster should advise the applicant for payment to communicate with the remitter, and request him to apply to the Comptroller of the Metropolitan Money-Order Office of the kingdom in which the order was issued, enclosing in his application the additional commission (in postage stamps) chargeable for the alterations required. No Letter Carrier or other servant of the Post-Office is bound to procure a Money-Order for any person, nor to obtain payment for one, but such services are not forbidden. No Money-Order business must be transacted on the Sunday ; but for the convenience of the la- bouring classes the office must be kept open on the Saturday night till eight o'clock (or as near that horn- as the despatch of the mail will allow), except where the Surveyor shall consider Buclx arrange- ment oauecessaiy.</page><page objectIdentifierValue="83538544" pageOrder="480">4GS POSTAGE DIRECTORY — MISCELLA^^EOUS RULES.

LIFE ASSOCIATION OF SCOTLAND, JounbetJ 1S3S— CSmpatoerEt fig ^a^d Cljarter anti ^ct of parltament. The Association has now in operation two Separate Schemes of Assurance, THE ORIGINAL SCHEME-(Class A), is expressly based on the principle of reducing the expense of Life Assurance as low as is consistent Tvith permanent security, and offers tlie fullowinp^, among other advantan^cs: — FREEDOM FROM RESTRICTIONS. — Tiie Policies now being issued are unusually free from restrictions (as commonly imposed by other Companies), and confer important privileges. These relate to Non-payment of Premiums — Indisputability — Limits of Residence and Occupa- tion— Jlilitary and Naval Service, &amp;c., and afford, in most cases, almost complete protection ajrainst forfeiture. PROFIT SCHEME. — A share of Profits is allocated yearly to every Policy-holder of five years' standing at the preceding annual balance, and is applied so as to reduce the present outlay for his Policy. The allocations to Policy-holders of the First Series (namely, those as yet entitled to Profits), have this year been so much as 37^ per cent, (namely, 7s. Gd. per £1) of the Annual Premiums. Examples : — Age at Entry. Annual Premiums for £LOuO. Return of Profit by Office. Premiums thus reduced to 25 35 45 55 60 £ 8. d. 21 18 4 28 10 38 11 8 56 13 4 69 1 8 £ s. d. 8 4 4 10 13 9 14 9 4 21 5 25 18 1 £ a. d. 13 14 17 16 3 24 2 4 35 8 4 43 3 7 HALF-CREDIT SYSTEM.— Policies of £500 and upwards may be effected and kept up by pay- ment of only Oue-half the Premiums for the first six years, with interest on the other half. Examples : — Age at Eutrj-. PoUcyof£500. PoUcy of £1000. Policy of £20' 0. First Year's Payment. First Tear's Payment.

UNCONDITIONAL ASSURANCE ON LIFE, While the Policies of the Oii^nal Scheme have for many years been relieved of most of the imperfections which still adhere to Assurance Policies in general, the Association liave now met the desire of late manifested in some quarters for a system of Life Assurance still more simple and un- conditional^ and have introduced a Scheme with this special view. It is based on sound principles and precise calculations, and entirely obviates the objections to ordinary s}*stems of Assurance. The leading features of the Scheme are these : — OMISSION to pay a Premium by oversight does not affect the Assurance, and, after a time, Payment may be intentionally Postponed for a year. NO RESTRICTION is imposed as to Occupation or Residence. NO EXTRA PREMIUMS can ever be payable. The ASSURANCE is -virtually Non- forfeitable and Unquestionable. The POLICY-HOLDER, on surrendering his Policy, can withdraw a fixed and unusually larjfe proportion of his Payments, or he may in most cases take a paid-up Policy for double the amount ; or he may wiihdi-aw the same sum as a Loan, and still continue the P'olicy.

LIFE ASSURANCE. THE system of the NORTH BRITISH INSURANCE COMPANY combines the benefit of Mutual Assurance with the safety of a large Protecting Capital, and affords all the facilities and advan- tages which can prudently be offered by any Life Assurance Office. Progress of the Company. During tlie two years preceding the last Division of Profits, in December 1858, the smns assured amounted to £(154,356. During the two years &amp;v.cceeding the last Division of Profits, the sums assured amounted to £925,562. During the year 1860 alone, 741 New Policies were issued, assuring the sum of £475,649. Advantages offered by tMs Company. 1. Nine-tenths (90 per cent.) of the Profits, or, in other words, the whole of the Profits arising [Cojttinuen.</page><page objectIdentifierValue="83539180" pageOrder="533">INSURANCE DIRECTORY.

Bonuses may he added to tlic sum assured, or surrendered for a cash payment, or applied to the reduction of the future rremiums. 3. A Prospective Bonus of one per cent, per annum is allowed on Policies which have subsisted for five years, which may become claims previous to tiie next Investigation in IHii'j. 4. No Extra Charge for residence iu British North America, the Cape, Australia (exdudinj^ tlie Diggings), New Zealand, Port Natal, Buenos Ayres, and parts of the Linited States, and no licence required except for tlie voyage. 5. On proof of age, and by special application, Policies are declared unchallengeable from and after the expiry of Five Years Irom their date, and parties, on receiving a licence, may go to any pare of the Avorld without inciu'ring the forfeiture of their Policies — thus making the I'uliciea of the Cum- pany good marketable securities. Advances made on Policies, to tiie extent of the security they alVord, when the value amounts to £50 and upwards. NEW AND IMPORTANT ADVANTAGES. To meet the exigencies of parlies, and to render the bcnelits of Life Assurance more generally available, the Directors liave adopted the following new and important principles: — 1. Application of Profits to the Purchase of an Annuity. By this system a party not only secures the payment of the sum in the event of his dealli before 05, but at his option he may convert the Policy with its Bonuses into an equivalent Annuity com- mencing at 65. 2. Half Premium System. By which a party may secure all the benefits of the Half Credit System without any debt being incurred. 3. Double Insurance System, By which, for a moderate uniform Premiinn, a Policy may be secured, which will increase each year until, in 20 years, the sum iu the Policy is doubled. This system is partictilarly advantageous to young lives. For further explanation of these new principles, and for the Rates applicahle thereto.^ see the (Jompany's Prospectus. ANNUITIES. 1. Immediate Annuities are granted on favourable terms. 2. Deferred Annuities, to commence at any specified age, may be secured, either with or wiihout return of Premium. 3. Survivorship Annuities may be secured with or without return of Premimn. REVERSIONARY INTERESTS. The Company are ready either to purcliase Reversionary Interests and Life Rents, or to make advances on them to the extent of the security they atford. FIRE INSURANCE. - The Company INSURES against FIRE— Silk, Cotton, Woollen, and Flax Mills. Buildings of all descriptions. Furniture, Stock in Trade, Merchandise, Agricultm-al Stock, Implements of Husbandry, and effects of every kind, at the lowest rates of Premium corresponding to tiie risk. Farming Stock is Iiisitred without the Average Clause, and loss and damage by Lightning thereon made good. No charge is made for Policies when the sum insured amounts to £300, or for Transfers from other Offices. Insurance for seven years charged for six years only. Losses settled with promptittide and liberality. A duty of 3s. per cent, per annum on all pro- perty Insured from Fire in Great Britain and Ireland is payable to Government, with the exception of Farming Stock and Public Hospitals, wliicii are exempt. The Company holds itself responsible for damage done by explosion of Gas, such explosion taking place within buildings on or in which this Company has insurance, without extra charge.

ECONO:VIY OF MANAGEMENT.— The expenses of management of the LANCASHIRE IXSUR ANCE COMPANY, are the least in proportion to the Income of any of the fifty-two Companies who have rendered their Accounts to the Registrar-General, under the Joint Stock Companies' Act. {See Pamphlet by R. Christie, Esq., Scottish Equitable Office, Edinburgh.) The great extent of the Fire Business of the Company enables tlie Directors so to apportion the expenses of management, as to charge the Life Department with its proper costs only, thus giving Assurers with The Lancashire Insurance Company, all the real benefits ofl:ered by a Mutual Office, without any of its drawbacks. THE RATES OF PRE.MIUil are extremely moderate, but calculated by an eminent and expe- rienced Actuary, and are ample on First-class Lives to produce a Large Bonus Fund, which will be Divisible amongst the Assured in 18G3. JIEDICAL FEES.— All Medical Fees and other Charges paid by the Company. STAMP DUTIES not Charged, and Policies are issued free of any expense ichatever beyond the? Premium. RIFLE, ARTILLERY, MILITIA, or YEOMANRY CORPS.— Policies wiU be issued to persons ■ serving in these Corps, free of any additional charge.

THE ONLY OFFICE WHICH COMBINF.S, IN ONE SCALE OF CONTRIBUTIONS, THE BENEFIT OF PARTICIPATION IN THE WHOLE PROFITS WITH MODERATE PREMIUMS. THE PREMIUMS, at early and middle ap;es, are about a fourth lower than in the other Mntnal or Participating Offices. They are about a.s low as the Non-Participating rates of the Proprie- tary Companies— which they admit of being, not only with safety, but with ample reversion of Profits to the Policy-holders, being free from the burden of Dividends to Shareholders. Examples of Annual Premium to Assure £100 at Death. ' Age 25 30 35 40 45 £0 £1 18 £2 1 6 £2 6 10 £2 14 9 £3 5 9 £4 17 Thus, a person of 30 may secnre £1000 at death, for a yearly payment of £20, 15s., which, if paid to any of the other Mutual Offices, would secure a Policy for £800 onif, instead of £1000. PROFITS. The principle on which the PROFITS are divided will commend itself as not only safe and equitable, but as the most satisfactory method on which the Profits arising from Moderate Premiums could be allocated. Instead of being frittered away among all Policies indiscriminately — including those which have subsisted only a few years, and on which there may eventually be a heavy loss to the Common Fund — they are reserved lor those Members who alone can have made Surplus Payments ; in other words, for those whose Premiums, with accumulated Interest, amount to the sums iu their Policies. THE PRACTICAL WORKING of the system has been that, at the two Septennial Divisions which have been reported, addi- tions have been made to Policies coming within the Participating Class, varying, according to their value, from 12 or 14 to 70 or 78 per cent. The class of participating contributors now embraces, with few exceptions, all who entered in the earlier years of the Institution, and also many more recent entrants paying a higher rate ot premium. In this way, policies originally for £1000, which have shared at the two septennial divisions, have been increased to £1300, £1500, or £1700, and in some instances to £1780. The Administration has uniformly been conducted with liberal'ty towards the Members (there being in fact no opposing interests), and with readiness to initiate and adopt every available improve- Diept, such as relaxation of restrictions on travel, provision for the indefeasibility of Policies, and facility of settlement ot claims.

LIFE ASSURANCE GOMPANT. HEAD OFFICE— 5 GEORGE STREET, EDINBURGH. THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE EARL OF ELGIN AND KINCARDINE. COLONIAL AND FOREIGN ASSURANCES. THE COLONIAL LIFE ASSURANCE COMPANY was established at Eclinbiirgh in 1846, and introduced new and important features into Life Assurance practice, by publishing rates calcu- lated for Foreign residence, and by establishing Agencies abroad, thus afii&amp;gt;r(ling increased facilities to persons whose views or occupations might lead them to travel or reside in otlier countries. By its means, also, the benefits of Life Assurance were extended to India and to tlie Colonies of Great Bri- tain &amp;lt;;enerally, on such beneficial terms, and under such liberal conditions, as improved knowledge and the circumstances of the times authorised and required. The progress of the business has been most successful and satisfactory in everj- respect, and its extent has proved how gi-eatlj' such an institution was wanted. The Rates of the Compaky for Colonial and Foreign residence will be found moderate ; and looking to the lacilities and advantages aftbrded by the Company, they may be considered more advantageous, and virtually less expensive, than those of any otlier Office doing business abroad. For the purpose ot giving increased facilities, also, in tiie Company's transactions, the Directors have formed Local Boards of Management, and Brancli Offices, in India and the Colonies, where Assurances may be eftected, Premiums paid, and Claims settled. HOME ASSURANCE. The DiRECTons of the Colonial Life Assurance Company having directed much attention to the Classification of Risks in connexion with Lives Abroad, in wliicli they have been most successful, have turned their attention to the Classification of Hojie Risks, so as to give Proles- sional Men, and settled persons of all classes, whose occupations are not likely to call them beyond the limits of Europe, the advantage and privilege of possessing Policies unfettered by restrictions as to foreign residence, on term? which the absence of such extra risks authorises them to adopt. Tlie Directors have, in accordance with these views, resolved to grant to Persons resident in tiiia Country, whose occupation, profession, or calling, infers a residence in the United Kingdom, and who declare that they have no intention or prospect of going abroad, POLICIES WITHOUT ANY RESTRICTION AS TO RESIDENCE. It is not possible to state exactly the Professions which this Class will embrace, and much will depend on the features and particulars of each case ; but the Directors may mention a few Professions and Occupations which the new Class will include : — Country Gentlemen, Barristers and Advocates, Solicitors, and otlier Laic Af/ents, Settled Medical Practitioners, Beneficed Clergymen, Mamifac- turers. Agriculturists, Retail Shopkeepers, and others of like position ; it being a rule, however, that no Policy under this Class shall be issued on the life of any one below the age of 25, unless he shall have settled in life. — The Home Rates of Premium are moderate. For example: — Age 23. Age 35. \Yith Profits £2 10 £2 13 10 Without Profits, 1 17 7 2 9 4 Age 45. £3 14 2 per cent. 3 7 11 DIVISION OF PROFITS.

EXAMPLE. — A person aged 25 next birthday, assuring his life for £500, would pay an Annual Premium of £10, 12s. lid.; should he live and continue his payments until the periodical division of Profits, each time his share thereof would be placed to the credit of his Policy, and be applied to the extinction of his last payments of Premiums, thereby converting the Policy into one payable in hi.i lifetime. INDISPUTABILITY OF POLICIES.— After having been in force a period of five years, Policies ARE ABSOLUTELY INDEFEASIBLE and INDISPUTABLE ; and all right to question them on any ground wiiatever after that time is renounced and discharged. A Special Clause to this eftect is con- tained in the Deed of Settlement of the Association. ANNUITIES are granted on liberal and equitable terms, an increased rate being allowed on invalid lives.

TT is a disgrace to Science that any doubt should ever have been thrown, by any scientific man, uj)on -■- the nature of this substance, now so well known everywhere throughout the civilised globe as ' The Torbanehill Mineral,' with tlie alias, when under disgrace, of 'Boghead Gas Coal.' Kine-tenths, or even a larger majority, of all scientific men, led by those who are at the head of their departments of the various physical sciences, are now quite at one on the subject. The States of the Zollverein, and the Prussian Government, decided, years ago, that the substance in question Ls not coal, and so not liable to customs-duty. And lately, the French authorities also have pronounced the substance to be bituminous schist [^ bifiimc solide, ou pierre dc schiste'), and therefore able to pass into France free of tlie duty leviable upon coal. That the base of this mineral is purely a clay, and not, as happens in the case of all coals, preponderating fixed carbon = charcoal or cinder, is a fact now as well known everywhere as any physical fact of the kind can be. It is, moreover, well-known that the mineral substance in question gives 75 per cent, of a valuable tar or oil, capable, by easy purifying and rectifying processes, of yielding a highly valuable, because most economical, illuminating oil, as well as thicker oil, vLseful for all sorts of lubricating purposes, solid paraffine, and other important products. That on a clay base, equal to one fourth in weight of the substance, there should be superinduced the enormous proportion of three-fourths, or 75 per cent, of oil, — usually called, as it is, 'paraffine oil' — is one of the wonderful facts relating to a mineral which is surrounded by an atmosphere of wonders. Tlie Torbanehdl Mineral, in fine, is one of the most astonishing discoveries of the day, in an age of physical discoveries. It must be exceedinglj" gratifying, therefore, to all the patrons of physical science, and indeed to all lovers of truth, that an opportunity is about to be afforded, for the fullest discussion, by the scientific men of all countries in Chi'istendom, on the nature and peculiar qualities of this celebrated substance. If the physical sciences singly — if all the physical sciences united — be not adequate to tell whether this thing be coal, or oil-clay, what are the physical sciences worth? In fine, the mineral has had much elat al- ready, and is likely to have stiU a gi-eat deal more celebrity, higher and better. Its fame will be world- wide. The opportunit}' alluded to will be afforded by an action which Mr and Mrs Gillespie of Torbanehill have instituted against Messrs Young, Binney, and Meldrum, of the Chemical Works, near Bathgate, and in the immediate vicinity of Torbanehill itself. It is nowise necessai-y to detail, on the present occasion, many particidars regarding the nature and operation of the law action in question ; it may suf- fice to state, that, whereas Mr- and Mrs Gillespie have been injured, and are in course of being injured, to a vast extent, by that Chemical Company's operations, in lowering and keeping down the price of the Torbanehill Mineral in the market, by their alleged patent, Mr and Mrs Gillespie conclude against that company, on this ground (among other grounds), that, whatever Patent, good or bad, they may liave applicable to coal, it cannot, with any propriety, or without ^-iolation to truth, be held to be appli- cable to the Torbanehill Mineral, which is not coal at all, but is, in truth, a new mineral, it being indeed ' a new mineral substance, having an argillaceous base, and of so peculiar a nature as to constitute it a new and very peculiar variety of bituminous schist, shale, or clay,' and generally called 'The Tor- banehill Mineral.' The scientific world will learn with pleasure the information that so satisfactory an investigation is to be afforded. All scientific gentlemen, whether Chemists, Slicroscopists, Mineralogists, or Geologists, as well aa all practical men, engaged in any occupation which requires, or may permit, for anj- purpose, the use of the Torbanehill Mineral, — in whatever country of Europe, or part of North America, — who feel dis- posed to bear testimony to the truth concerning this substance, by declaring their reasons for holding it not to he coal, are requested to send their names, without delay, to Sir Gillespie of Torbaueliill, Scotland, (Office, 7 North St David Street, Edinbui-gh), or to any of his agents in England or Scotland, namely : — Messrs CONNELL &amp; Hope, Solicitors, Westminster.

Reasons why the Proprietors of the OPEEATIA?'E HAT FACTORY can SELL CHEAPER than any other House in Town:— 1st, We are hard-working men, and live by the sweat of our brow. 2d, We have Commodious Premises at a very Low Rent. 3d, We buy our Material with Ready Money, and Sell for the same. 4th, We make as Good Hats as possibly can be made. 5th, We have been in the employment of the First Manufacturers in the Three King- doms, and for the last few years have wrought for Mr M'Caskie of Edinburgh, in all of which we held ?t, first-class position as luorkraen. 6th, We do not pretend to sell Hats supe- rior to every one else ; but this we honestly, firmly, and fearlessly assert, that we can sell Cheaper than any other shop can do. The reason of tliis is plain to every luiprejudiced mind ; owing to our small expense — buying our materials with cash, and getting them up ourselves — we are in a position to feel inte- rested in the honour of oui' name as Manu- facturers, and are enabled to seU them Cheaper than Gentlemen who must pay very high rents (from £G0 to ^300) — who must pay i^ropor- tionate taxes and other incidental expenses — who must live in a style becoming their posi- tion and standing in high society — who must, to do all this, impose enormous profits upon their Customers. We can, will, and shall avoid all this by adhering to these rules, — hard work, small profits, and a quick return ; thus commanding the attention of the Public to the honest and persevei'ing eSbrts of Work- ing Men.
