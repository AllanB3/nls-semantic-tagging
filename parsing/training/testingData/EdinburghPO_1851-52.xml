Explanation. — In the Left-hand Table are the years of the Century, and above each is the Dominical Letter corresponding with that Year. Then, opposite to the Month, at the foot of the Kight-hand Table, will be found a corresponding Letter, over which are placed the Days of the Month and Week for that Month (distinguishing the Sundays by a different type). Each Blank Space in the Left-hand Table shows the year following to be Leap Year ; and as every Leap Year has two Dominical Letters, the Letter above the Blank Space must be used for January and February in every Leap Year, and for the other months, use the Letters belonging to the respective Years. By transposing the Dominical Letters, this Calendar would answer for any Century.</page><page objectIdentifierValue="83071998" pageOrder="13">COUNTING-HOUSE CALENDAR, 1851-2.

When the Estate has been over-estimated, or effects improperly included, a corrected inventory must be exhibited, engrossed on a stamp corresponding to the true amount, and allowance of the original stamp will be got as a spoiled stamp within six months from the date of recording the corrected inventory. Forms of the affidavit may be got at the Solicitor's Office, where, after being sworn, it is lodged along with a full copy of the original inventory and relative oath. RETURN OF INVENTORY-DUTY. A return of the duty paid on the inventory may be obtained if the personal debts due by the deceased at the time of his death reduce the estate to a sum in respect of which a less stamp-duty is payable than has actually been paid. The claim is made by affidavit and schedule, according to regulations, to be had from the Solicitor of Inland Revenue, and requires to be lodged with him (the days for this purpose are Monday and Friday, between twelve and two o'clock) within three years from the date of the inventory, and to be accompanied by a copy of the recorded inventory and stamped appraisements, vouchers, &amp;c, of the constitution of the debts (such as bonds, bills, accounts, &amp;c), and of the pay- ment. The time for lodging the claim, if expired, may be extended on application, by letter addressed to the Secretary of the Board of Stamps and Taxes, London. REGULATIONS AS TO EXCHANGING SPOILED STRIPS. The Solicitor's Office, No. 5 in the Inland Revenue Office, is open for the allowance of spoiled stamps on Tuesday and Thursday, every week, from twelve noon to two P.M. The distributors of stamps at the following places also receive spoiled stamps for allowance : Glasgow, Ayr, Kilmarnock, Dumfries, Perth, Dundee, Aberdeen, Banff, and Elgin. A supply of forms of affidavits is kept by the Solicitor and the above distributors, and claimants may attend at the Solicitor's office, and have the affidavits filled up and taken ; or they may get copies of the forms, and take the oath before a justice of the peace, and afterwards lodge the affidavits and the stamps with any of the above officers. If the claim be admitted, a ticket is issued, stating that appli- cation is to be made for the new stamps after Thursday se'ennight, and within six weeks from the date of the ticket. If not made within that time, the claim will be forfeited. The stamps, if belonging to parties resident in Edinburgh, or within ten miles thereof, must be pre- sented for allowance within six months after being signed in the case of executed instruments, and six months after being spoiled in the case of unexecuted instruments. If beyond that distance, six months in the former, and twelve months in the latter case. Bills and notes delivered to payees, or negotiated, or issued in any way, and bills accepted or ten- dered for acceptance, cannot be exchanged, unless a new bill be produced, in all respects the same, excepting the correction of the error.

XXV Unexecuted instruments are allowed, if inadvertently spoiled. Executed, that is, signed by any party, if void in law from the beginning ; from error, or mistake, unfit for the purposes originally in- tended ; from the death or refusal to sign of any person whose signature is necessary ; from the want of the signature of some material and necessary party ; from refusal to act under ; or from non-accep- tance, they shall be unfit for or fail of the purpose intended, or if the transaction be carried through by another instrument duly stamped. — (Sec 53 Geo. III., cap. 108.) Transfers of stock, if signed by the seller alone, and other instruments if by one party, new deeds require to be produced to the proper officer of stamps, who, as to transfers, is instructed to certify in what particulars they differ from those spoiled. Stamps of a different description may be obtained for any stamp spoiled, if it be of the value of £G or upwards. Application for this purpose to the Commissioners of Stamps and Taxes should be lodged with the affidavit. The Commissioners, by 3 and 4 Will. IV., cap. 97, sec. 19, may, if in their dis- cretion they think fit, refund, in money, the amount of spoiled stamps. They are also authorized to repay the amount of stamps for which the possessor has no immediate use, if applied for within three months after being purchased. In both cases is deducted the per centage allowed by law on the pur- chase of stamps. STAMPING DEEDS AFTER BEING SIGNED. Beyond Twelve Months. — The duty, or deficiency of duty, shall be due and payable to her Majesty, and also the penalty of £10. The deed will only be stamped on payment of the whole, or (as the case may be) the deficiency of the stamp-duty remaining payable on it, and, over and above such duty, a penalty of £10; and if the whole amount of said duty or deficiency shall exceed £10, then, in addition to said duty and penalty, there shall be paid, by way of additional penalty, interest on the duty or deficiency at the rate of 5 per cent from the date or first signing of the deed ; but such interest shall not exceed the amount of the said duty, or deficiency of duty. Within Twelve Months. — If the deed shall be brought to the Commissioners of Inland Revenue within twelve months after the first signing or executing, in order to be stamped, it may be stamped without payment of the penalty, or on payment only of a portion thereof, provided it shall be proved to the satisfaction of the Commissioners, that the deed was not didy stamped previously to being signed, by reason of accident, mistake, inadvertency, or urgent necessity, and without any wilful design to evade or delay the payment of duty. — (13 and 14 Vic, c. 97, sec. 12.) Abroad. — If the deed shall be executed by any party abroad, it may be stamped without any penalty, if brought to be so within two calendar months from the time of being received in the kingdom, .upon proof of the facts to the satisfaction of the Commissioners. — (13 and 14 Vic, e. 97, sec. 13.) DOUBTS AS TO THE SUFFICIENCY OF STAMPS MAY BE REMOVED. The opinion of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue as to the duty to which a deed, whether pre- viously stamped or otherwise, is chargeable, may be obtained on payment of a fee of 10s. The duty 0" insufficient duty which the Commissioners may assess, and the penalty, if any, being paid, they s nill stamp the deed with the duty so paid, and thereupon, and also in the ease of the deed being pre- viously sufficiently stamped, shall also impress the deed with a particular stamp to be provided for the purpose. The deed shall then be received in evidence, notwithstanding any objection to it as insuffi- ciently stamped. The provision does not apply to bonds or mortgages for unlimited amounts, nor instruments after being signed, prohibited from being stamped. The opinion of the Commissioners may be appealed against to the Court of Exchequer at Westminster, on the stamp-duties assessed being paid, and 40s. for costs being deposited. — (13 and 14 Vic, c 97, sec 14 and 15.)

Inland Letters and Packets, including those from the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, if prepaid, are subject to the following rates of postage : — Not exceeding half an ounce in weight, . . . Id.- one ounce, 2d. two ounces, 4d, And so on, two rates being added for every ounce. Addresses to Her Majesty pass free, also Petitions to Parliament, if under thirty-two ounces, and in covers open at the ends. Letters and Packets, under four ounces in weight, may be sent unpaid, but are charged double</page><page objectIdentifierValue="83076222" pageOrder="365">POSTAGE DIRECTORY. 353 the amount of postage to which they would have been liable had they been prepaid ; and no Letter or Packet exceeding that weight can be forwarded by Post without prepayment. ADHESIVE STAMPS AND ENVELOPES. Letters inclosed in Stamped Covers, or having Stamps affixed to them, the Stamps in every such case being equal to the rates of Postage chargeable on such Letters, if prepaid, will pass free of all other Postage Charge, in whatever part of the United Kingdom they may be posted. In those cases where the value of the Stamps on the Letter is less than the amount of Postage to which it is properly liable, the Letter will be charged double the amount of such deficiency on delivery. The same rule applies to Letters under-paid in money. Adhesive Stamps should be placed on the front of the Letter, and upon the right-hand corner of the upper side; and care should be taken that they firmly adhere to the Letter. The better me- thod is to wet the Letter, not the Stamp. Every Postmaster, Sub-Postmaster, and Letter- Receiver, without exception, will sell the Postage Label .Stamps and Envelopes to the Public at the following Prices ;— &amp;lt; The Penny Label Stamps at Id. each. The Twopenny ditto . 2d. Tenpenny ditto . lOd. Shilling ditto . . Is. The Penny Envelopes, 24 for 2s. 3d., or 2 for 2£d. REGISTERED LETTERS. The system of registration provides a secure mode of transmitting Bank Notes, Bank Post Bills, Drafts, &amp;c. &amp;c. The arrangements have been made with the view of insuring the punctual deli very of Letters of value; on their delivery, the parties to whom they may have been addressed will be required to acknowledge in writing their receipt. Letters offered for Registration must have the full amount of postage in stamps affixed thereon, and the registration fee of Sixpence must be paid in Monet. Registered Letters will be taken at the General Post-Office, at the Receiving- Houses, and by all Postmasters throughout the United Kingdom, until within half an hour of the closing of the Box for the particular Mail or Bag bj r which they are to be despatched. An acknowledgment by receipt will be given to the parties registering Letters, and each receipt must bear the Office stamp. The practice of committing Letters containing valuable property to the Post-Office unregistered should in all cases be avoided. It is expected that persons having occasion to transmit such letters, will avail themselves of the proper means of security, and in no case by committing property un- registered to the Letter-boxes, risk its loss. If, however, notes are sent, parties are recommended to cut them in halves, and the second half should not be despatched until the receipt of the first has been acknowledged. The numbers, dates, and amount, should also be carefully taken. REDIRECTED LETTERS. Redirected Letters are subject to additional rates of Postage ; but whether the Letters have been originally prepaid or not, they are only liable to be charged at the prepaid rate for the additional Postage. OVERCHARGES, DELAYS, &amp;c. In all cases of complaint, whether arising from overcharges, delays, or other irregularities, the covers (and contents in all practicable cases) should be forwarded to the Secretary, General Post- Office, for investigation, as affording the only efficient means of answering such complaints satis- factorily. Overcharges are returned between the hours of ten and four, at the window of the Paid- Letter Office, on presenting the cover, with the Secretary's authority written thereon. LETTERS NOT TO BE DELIVERED BACK. To prevent the possibility of Letters being surreptitiously obtained from the offices where put in, office-keepers are strictly forbid returning, to any person whomsoever, Letters that may be applied for, under whatever circumstances the recovery may be urged. This is, moreover, forbidden by the established principle, that the instant a Letter is committed to the Post, it is no longer the property of the sender. ILLEGAL CONVEYANCE OF LETTERS. By the 1st Victoria, cap. 36, sec. 2, any person illegally conveying Letters, incurs a penalty of £5 for every offence, and £100 for every week the practice is continued. The Sender also incurs a penalty of £5 for every offence, with full Costs of Suit.</page><page objectIdentifierValue="83076234" pageOrder="366">354 POSTAGE DIRECTORY. ARTICLES WHICH MAY NOT BE SENT BY POST. Letters or Packets cannot be forwarded, conveyed, or delivered by the Post-Office, containing any of the following inclosures, viz. : — any Glass or Glass Bottle, any Razor, Scissors, Knife, Fork, or other sharp or pointed instrument ; any Leeches, Game, Fish, Flesh, Fruit, Vegetable, or other perishable substance ; any Bladder, or other vessel containing liquid ; or any article, matter, or thing whatsoever, which might, by pressure or otherwise, be rendered injurious to the Officers of the Post-Office, or to the contents of the Mail-bags ; and the Act 3 and 4 Victoria, cap. 96, ex- pressly directs that no Letter shall be sent by Post containing any explosive or other dangerous material or substance. No Letter or Packet exceeding in breadth, or length, or depth, twenty- four inches measurement, can be forwarded by Post. PRINTED BOOKS, UNDER CERTAIN REGULATIONS, FORWARDED AT A REDUCED RATE. Books, Magazines, Reviews, and Pamphlets (whether British, Colonial, or Foreign), may be transmitted by the Post, within the United Kingdom, at the following reduced rates of Postage, viz : — Not exceeding 1 pound in weight, ... 6d. _ _ 2 — — 1b. Od. — — 3 — — . Is. 6d. and so on; 6d. being charged for every complete pound, or fraction of a pound, beyond. Every such Packet must be sent without a Cover, or in a Cover open at the ends or sides. It must con- tain a Single Volume only, the several sheets or parts thereof, when there are more than one, being sewed or bound together. It must not exceed two feet in length. The Postage must be prepaid in full by affixing on the Packet or its Cover the proper Stamps. The Name and Address of the Sender may be written or printed upon or in such Book, &amp;c, so sent, or on the Envelope thereof, in addition to the address. Any other writing may be on any leaf of the Book, &amp;c, or on the binding thereof, provided that it be on one and the selfsame page of the Booh, or corresponding portion of the binding. If any or either of the above conditions be violated, the Packet must be charged and treated as a Letter in every respect. To prevent any obstacles to the regular transmission of Letters, any Officer of the Post-Office may delay the transmission of any such Packet, for a time not exceeding twenty four hours from the time it would otherwise have been forwarded. NEWSPAPERS, AND SUPPLEMENTS TO NEWSPAPERS. It is not compulsory to send Newspapers or their Supplements by Post ; but those that are in- tended to be so transmitted must be sent in covers open at the sides ; and no words of communi- cation may be printed or written on such papers (except under the conditions hereafter ex- plained) after the same shall have been published, when they are entitled to pass free. Parties will be allowed, however, to put any Writing or Marks on Newspapers passing by Post, in the United Kingdom, provided that a Postage of a Penny be prepaid, by means of a Stamp con- spicuously affixed outside the Cover or folded Newspaper, it being understood that in those cases where the Newspaper may be liable to Postage, irrespective of such Writing or Marks (as when it is both posted and delivered in the same town), the Penny Stamp shall cover both the Writing and Postage. But this privilege is to be confined to Writing or Marks on the Newspaper itself, and not to extend to the Cover, which must contain nothing but the address. Any Writing or Marks on the Cover, besides the address, or on the Newspaper (if not prepaid as above), will subject it to the same rate as that of an Unpaid Letter, according to weight. Newspapers pass free by the Edinburgh Local Posts, except in those cases where they shall be posted and delivered within the limits of the General Post delivery (which now includes Leith), when the Postage is one penny on each Newspaper. Prices Current and Commercial Lists published in the United Kingdom, if duly stamped, and under the weight of two ounces, will be treated as Newspapers, and enjoy the Newspaper privileges, the sanction of the Postmaster-General having been previously obtained. *,,* As the mere affixing a Newspaper Stamp on any new periodical publication will not entitle it, as a matter of course, to pass free by the Post, those who may be about to publish, for the first time, any such paper, should submit a copy to the Postmaster- General, in order that it may be de- termined whether the Publication is of a nature that will entitle it to pass free of postage. Clause of the Act of 1st Victoria, cap. 34, sec. 32. — "And be it further enacted, that in all " cases, in which a question shall arise, whether a printed Paper is entitled to the privileges of a " Newspaper, or other Publication hereby privileged, so far as respects the transmission thereof " by the Post under the Post-Office acts, the question shall be referred to the determination of the</page><page objectIdentifierValue="83076246" pageOrder="367">POSTAGE DIRECTORY. 355 " Postmaster-General, wliose decision, with the concurrence of the Lords of the Treasury, shall be " final." Newspapers published in the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man are now excluded from the Newspaper privileges, except such as may be printed in the French language. . Printed Votes and Proceedings of the Imperial Parliament, or of the Colonial Legisla- tures, are charged, — Under four ounces, .... Id. Above four and under eight ounces, . 2d. Above eight and under twelve ounces, . 3d., and so on. Such Votes and Proceedings, whether paid or unpaid, pass at these rates between places in the United Kingdom, as well as to the Colonies, by Packet. The Postmaster-General is authorized (if he shall sec fit) to delay the transmission of Printed Votes and Proceedings in Parliament for any space not exceeding Twenty-four hours from the time at which the same would otherwise have been forwarded. FOREIGN AND COLONIAL LETTERS AND NEWSPAPERS. General Regulations. The prepayment of Postage is optional to many parts abroad, Foreign as well as Colonial. For information on this point, reference may be made to the List of Foreign Places, commencing at page 361. Letters for the Colonies and Foreign Countries posted unpaid, although specially addressed to be forwarded by routes which require the Postage to be paid in advance, will not, if there are any means of transmitting them, be opened and returned to the writers for payment of such postage, but will be despatched if possible by other routes unpaid. WEIGHT OF LETTERS. Letters being now charged by weight in this country, as well as abroad, the British scale of pro- gression as follows : — Not exceeding .| oz., one Rate. Do. do. 1 oz., two Rates. And two Rates for every succeeding oz. The French and Belgian scale of progression is as follows : — Under \ oz., one Rate. Weighing | oz., under A oz., two Rates. And one Bate for every succeeding \ oz. In charging the British and Foreign combined rates, it is to be observed, that a letter will be liable to two Foreign Rates if it reaches the \ oz. (the single rate being under that weight), whereas two British rates are not chargeable unless the letter exceeds \ oz. (the limit for a single British rate) ; so that a letter, to be subjeet to a single Foreign rate, as well as British, must be under a | oz. The following shews the method of taking the postage on letters for France and Belgium : — / r British, Os. 5d. \ / British, Os. 5d. „ ) under | of \ Foreign, Os. 5d. ( reaching \ of ) Foreign, Os. lOd. 1 an ounce. 1 — t an ounce. Belgium, under £ of J Foreign, Os. ?d. ( reaching £ of — ( an ounce. 6d. ) Os. 8d. SHIP LETTERS. The Rates of Postage on " Ship," as on other letters, are taken by weight. The single uniform rate on ship letters between the United Kingdom and any place beyond seas (except those for France, Belgium, Holland, Hamburg, Bremen, Brunswick, Hanover, Denmark, Oldenburg, Lubec, and Mecklenburg-Schwerin, to which places the rate is the same as by packet), when conveyed by private ship, is 8d. under the £ oz., and so on, in whatever part of the United Kingdom the same may be posted or delivered. Letters intended to be conveyed by "private ship" should be so addressed. 9 D</page><page objectIdentifierValue="83076258" pageOrder="368">356 POSTAGE DIRECTO RY. PERSONS EXEMPT FROM SHIP LETTER POSTAGE. The owners, charterers, and consignees, resident in the United Kingdom, and owners consignees, and shippers of goods on board vessels inward bound, are entitled to receive their letters free from sea postage (the inland postage only being chargeable) to the extent of 6 oz. collectively by any one vessel to any such person. In the case of vessels coming from Ceylon, the Mauritius, the East Indies, or the Cape of Good Hope, for an owner, charterer, or consignee of such vessel, the letters may collectively be 20 oz. in weight. The owner, charterer, or consignee must be described as such on the address or superscription ; and, in the case of ownpr.., consignees, or shippers of goods, it must also appear by the ship's manifest that they have goods on board the vessel. Such persons are entitled to have their letters which come within the above conditions, before the master of the vessel delivers the other letters in his charge to the Post-Ofiice. %* Any person who shall, with intent to evade any duty of postage, falsely superscribe a letter as being the owner, charterer, or consignee of a vessel conveying the same, or as the owner, shipper, or consignee of goods shipped in such vessel, shall, for every offence, forfeit £10. LETTERS NOT TO BE SEALED WITH WAX WHEN SENT TO WARM CLIMATES. The practice of sealing letters which pass to and from the East Indies, and other warm climates, with wax, leads to much inconvenience, from the melting of the wax, and the letters adhering to each other. The public, therefore, are recommended, in all such cases, to use wafers instead of wax, and to advise their correspondents to do the same. ADHESIVE STAMPS AND ENVELOPES. Stamps maybe used to pay Foreign or Colonial Letters outwards, but care must be taken that, by the addition of such stamps, the letters do not exceed the weight intended to be paid for. In those cases in which the value of the stamps on the letter is less than the amount of postage chargeable, they will, if prepayment is not compulsory, be forwarded charged with the difference. In cases where the prepayment is compulsory, they will be sent to the Dead Letter Office, and opened and returned to the writers for the proper postage. Stamps are not permitted to be used on letters arriving in the United Kingdom from the colonies or foreign countries. Whenever, there- fore, such letters bear any, they will be charged the full rate of postage, without regard to such stamps. These regulations will be applicable to newspapers in those cases where they are liable to postage. NEWSPAPERS AND PRICES CURRENT TO THE COLONIES AND FOREIGN COUNTRIES. Newspapers and Prices Current, duly stamped and authorized, provided the regulations are com- plied with, and they are posted within seven days of their publication, may be forwarded to the colonies and to foreign countries, by post-office packets or private ships. To the British colonies they ire forwarded free, except in cases where the conveyance is by private ship, as also to many foreign sountries, which will be found in the Lists. But to all places to which newspapers are not sent free, the postage on them must be paid in advance. Newspapers and Prices Current, duly stamped, to the colonies, by private ship, are charged one penny each. To France, Belgium, Holland, and countries through Holland, by private ship, one penny each. Chili, Peru, Guatemala, Western Coast of America, Venezuela, St Helena, St Mary's, River Gambia, Sierra Leone, Cape Coast Castle, Fernando Po, and Ascension Island, one penny each. All other places not British, by private ship, twopence each, which must bs prepaid. The undermentioned printed PRICES CURRENT having obtained the sanction of the Lords of the Treasur}', pass through the Post-Office to the colonies and foreign countries at One Penny each, provided they contain simply the names and prices of articles. The names and addresses of the parties dealing in such articles must be excluded: — London Mercantile Price Current, Annual Supplement to Prices Current.

Prices Current cannot be forwarded a second time without being charged full letter postage. Prices Current from any colony or place abroad by private ship, are charged the same rate as newspapers. Prices Current from any British colony by packet, direct to any place in the United Kingdom, one penny each. Prices Current from any foreign country by packet (except France, Belgium, Holland, and China), direct to the United Kingdom, twopence each. Prices Current from whatever part (except China) received by way of France, Belgium, Holland, or Hamburg, twopence eacn. PERIODICAL PUBLICATIONS, &amp;c. Periodical works, unstamped, and not of daily publication, parliamentary proceedings, &amp;c, may be forwarded to and from France, Belgium, Bremen (via Hamburg), Hamburg, Lubcck (via Ham- burg), Oldenburg, Holland, Prussia {via Holland), and the United States (but not to countries passing through), under the following regulations: — 1st, The postage mast be paid in advance (except those from). 2d, They must be sent in covers open at the sides for examination. 3d, They must be printed in the English language, or the language of the country they are sent from. The rate on such works will be as follows: — Not exceeding 2 oz. in weight, one penny. Not exceeding 3 oz. in weight, sixpence. And twopence for every additional ounce to 16 inclusive, beyond which weight no publication can be forwarded except paid for as letters. Plates of fashions, music, &amp;c, accompanying newspapers and periodicals, are to be considered as part of such publication, and are not liable to extra charge. Prints published with newspapers, and duly stamped, may be sent by post separately as a newspaper $ but those bearing the supple- ment stamp of id. only must be sent with the paper it belongs to, and be under the weight of two ounces. Periodicals posted without previous payment will be forwarded as unpaid letters, and no single pamphlet, or work unnumbered, and without reference to its continuance at any other time or period, can be considered or taken to be a periodical. Pamphlets, although not published periodically, may be forwarded to the United States at the same rates as above, when not exceeding eight ounces. PRINTED VOTES AND PROCEEDINGS OF THE IMPERIAL PARLIAMENT, AND OF THE COLONIAL LEGISLATURES, Whether paid or unpaid, pass at the same rates to the colonies, by packet, as between places in the United Kingdom. Where there are no packets, they may be forwarded by private ships at double these rates. They are not, however, forwarded to places through France, under the lull rates of letter postage. The following are the rates chargeable : — Under 4 oz., Id. Above 4 oz. and under 8 oz., 2d. Above 8 oz. and under 12 oz., 3d. — and so on. BOOKS SENT AT REDUCED RATES TO CERTAIN COLONIES.

And so on, increasing Is. for every additional pound or fraction of a pound; provided, however, that the following conditions be carefully observed : — 1st, Every such packet must be sent without a cover, or in a cover open at the ends or sides. 2d, It must contain a single volume only (whether printed book, magazine, review, or pamphlet), the several sheets or parts thereof, where there are more than one, being sewed or bound together. 3d, It must not exceed two feet in length, breadth, width, or depth. 4th, It must have no writing or marks upon the cover, or its contents, except the name and ad- dross of the person to whom it may be sent. 5th, The postage must be prepaid in full, by affixing outside the packet or its cover the proper number of stamps. If any of the above conditions be violated, the packet must be charged as a letter, and treated as such in all respects. REGISTERED LETTERS, FOREIGN, COLONIAL, AND SHIP. In the case of foreign, colonial, or ship registered letters, it must be clearly understood that re- gistration cannot extend beyond the port of despatch in the United Kingdom ; and the office does not engage- for the security of any registered foreign, colonial, or ship letter longer than while the contents of the mail shall be in the custody of the British Post-Office. Letters, however, addressed to France, and letters passing through France, are exceptions to this rule, the French Post-Office undertaking to provide for their security till they shall have been delivered, if addressed to France, and so long as they remain in the French territory, if passing through France. All registered letters to and from France, and countries passing through France, must be paid to their destination, or to the farthest limit, and are subject to the following regulations : — 1st, A registration fee of sixpence in addition to the British portion (or rate) of the postage upon such letters. 2d, The foreign portion of the rate must be calculated, and the amount doubled. Registered letters for Belgium and countries through Belgium, — — Holland and countries through Holland, — — Hamburg and countries through Hamburg, are charged with the British registration fee only, in addition to the postage an ordinary letter would be liable to, and the postage must be prepaid. Registered letters for Prussia, or to foreign countries through Prussia, must be prepaid the full postage (British and Foreign) as well as the British registration fee of sixpence, and a further charge of threepence on each registered letter, whatever may be its weight, on account of the Prussian registration fees. It is hoped that the public will take ithe precaution to register all letters of value. REDIRECTED LETTERS. Redirected letters between France, Belgium, and Holland, and countries the correspondence of which passes through France, Belgium, and Holland, and the United Kingdom, are returned charged with the same amount of postage that should have been paid by the receivers. Letters originating in the United Kingdom, redirected from France, Belgium, or Holland, are returned under the same conditions, and are liable to a farther charge of British postage — viz., 5d. from Calais, and 8d. from Holland. All other redirected letters, which cannot be forwarded without prepayment of postage, must be sent to the Dead Letter Office to be returned for the amount due — viz., for their conveyance to the United Kingdom (if the postage to the United Kingdom is not paid), and for the further amount from the United Kingdom to the place of redirection. REDIRECTED NEWSPAPERS. Newspapers originating in the United Kingdom, addressed to parties in France, Belgium, and Holland, who have returned, may be redirected (on the original covers) to them, and are liable to the first charge only. Newspapers from the colonies and foreign countries, for persons who may have removed, may be redirected to them at any place within the United Kingdom free of postage, provided they have not been opened at the place to which they were originally addressed. But a newspaper which has been opened is charged at the same rate as if it were a letter from the place of redirection to the place at, which it may be ultimately delivered. Newspapers upon which any colonial or foreign postage may be due when redirected, shall be delivered at any place within the United Kingdom for the</page><page objectIdentifierValue="83076294" pageOrder="371">POSTAGE DIRECTORY. 359 same amount of postage that would have been chargeable had they been delivered at their original address. Newspapers from one foreign country or colony to another, in transit through, and ad- dressed to the care of a person in, the United Kingdom, may be redirected forward without extra charge, provided they have not been out of the custody of the Post-Office; but such newspapers cannot be reposted without incurring the charge of letter postage. NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICERS, SEAMEN, AND SOLDIERS IN HER MAJESTY'S SERVICE ABROAD. Letters to seamen and soldiers may be forwarded by post at the rate of one penny each, under the following regulations : — 1st, The penny must be paid at the time the letter is put into the Post-Office. 2d, The direction must signify the class of seaman or soldier. 3d, The name of the ship, regiment, or corps, to which he belongs. 4th, The letter must not exceed half an ounce, and be upon their private concerns only. Letters for seamen and soldiers, whether in her Majesty's or the East India Company's military or naval service (while on actual service), may be forwarded, under the foregoing regulations, to India, China, &amp;c, via Southampton. They can now be sent to India, via Marseilles, on payment of the British rate of Id., besides the French rate of 5d. if under a quarter of an ounce, or lOd. exceeding that weight, or to any foreign country, on payment of the foreign rate of postage in addition to the British rate of Id. as above. Letters for seamen and soldiers forwarded by private ships (with the following exceptions) : — St Helena, East Indies, New South Wales, Cape of Good Hope, and Mauritius, are charged 3d. each. Letters of soldiers and seamen, addressed to the United States of America, will in future be chargeable with the American rate of five cents, or twopence-halfpenny sterling each, in addition to the ordinary British rate of one penny ; the postage of all such letters must be prepaid. Warrant officers, either in the army or navy, or masters' mates, or engineers of the navy, are not entitled to transmit letters at less than the usual rates of postage. Seamens or soldiers' letters received from any part beyond sea, upon which the said penny has not been prepaid, shall be charged to the receiver with double the rate — viz., 2d. each. REDIRECTED LETTERS FOR OFFICERS, SOLDIERS, AND SEAMEN. Letters redirected to commissioned officers in the army or navy, subject to foreign or colonial postage, may be forwarded to such officers when removed upon service (whether at home or abroad), and be delivered to them for the same amount of postage that would have been chargeable had they been delivered at their original address. In all other cases they are subject to the same regulation as ordinary redirected letters. Soldiers' and seamen's letters are not liable to any additional rate upon redirection. NEWSPAPERS, PERIODICALS, &amp;c, CHARGED FOR IRREGULARITIES. Newspapers posted out of date, written on, or in any way marked for reference, or containing any thing contran r to the act, or without being prepaid, will, if there be no means of forwarding them as unpaid letters, be sent to the Dead Letter Office. When they can be forwarded, those out of date, or not prepaid as required, will be charged with the ordinary letter postage. Newspapers posted in France, contrary to the established regulations of that country, are trans- mitted to this country as letters. British newspapers reposted in France for England are charged with the British frontier postage of 5d. per half ounce.</page><page objectIdentifierValue="83076306" pageOrder="372">360 POSTAGE DIBECTOllY.

MONEY ORDER OFFICE. Money Orders are issued and paid at the General Post-0 Sice, Edinburgh, between the hours of 10 and 4. The Commission chargeable for Money Orders is threepence on sums not exceeding £2 ; and on sums above £2, and not exceeding £5, sixpence. No Order will be given for sums beyond this amount. The Money Order Office, and the system of Registration, have been devised expressly for the se- curity of Money and other valuable property transmitted through the Post-Office. With the great convenience thus afforded for transmitting small sums at so low a charge, and the power given of Registering Letters containing value, it is hoped the public will no longer forward letters of value except in one or other of these methods. In all cases where personal attendance is inconvenient, if the Money Order is receipted by the person to whom it is made payable, and the party presenting it for payment can afford full infor- mation as to the Christian name, surname, address, and occupation of the person zoho originally obtained the Order, payment will be made; but unless these conditions are strictly complied with, it will be refused. Any Money Order presented through a bank, will be paid, without the name of the remitter and the signature in full of the Christian name of the payer being insisted upon as a condition of payment, provided that the bank be situated in the town on which the Money Order is drawn, that the Order be crossed with the banker's name, and that the party applying at the Money Order Office be known there as in the employment of the baDk. It must be understood, however, that in all such cases the liability of the Post-Office will absolutely terminate with the Payment of the Order so presented. With a view to simplicity and economy in the accounts of the Money Order Office, it has been found necessary to lay down the following Rules : — 1. Every Money Order issued on or after the 6th October 1848, must be presented for payment before the end of the second calendar month after that in which it was issued (for instance, if issued in October, it must be presented for payment before the end of December), otherwise a new Order will be necessary, for which a second commission must be paid. 2. If an Order be not presented for payment before the end of the twelfth calendar month after that in which it was issued (for instance, if issued in October, and not presented before the end of the next October), the Money will not be paid at all. 3. As, after once paying a Money Order, by whomsoever presented, the Office will not be liable to any further claim, the public are strictly cautioned — a. To take all means to prevent the loss of the Money Order. o. Never to send a Money Order in the same letter with the information required on payment thereof. c. To be careful, on taking out a Money Order, to state correctly the Christian name as well as the surname of the person in whose favour it is to be drawn. d. To see that the name, address, and occupation, of the person taking out the Money Order, are correctly known to the person in whose favour it is to be drawn. 4. Neglect of these instructions will lead to delay and trouble in obtaining payment, and even risk the loss of the Money. These instructions, together with some others of minor importance, will be found printed on every Money Order. The following is the list of places in Scotland, England, Wales, and Ireland, upon which alone Money Orders can be drawn, and at which they can be issued. A Money Order intended for a person residing at a place in which there is no Money Order Office, should be drawn upon the Post- Town nearest to it, which may have a Money Order Office ; —</page><page objectIdentifierValue="83076414" pageOrder="381">POSTAGE DIRECTORY. 369 LIST OF POST-TOWNS IN SCOTLAND WHICH ALONE GRANT AND PAY MONEY ORDERS.

[Continued.</page><page objectIdentifierValue="83076966" pageOrder="427">INSURANCE DIRECTORY. HI , Mutual Assurance— Scottish Widows' Fund Life Assurance Society— continued. I^HE Principle of Mutual Assurance is such, that whatever portion of the Annual Premiums is rot . actually required for the risk of the Assurance, is appropriated' for the benefit of the Assured. There are no Dividends payable to Proprietors, and the Assured ore the only parties who are in any way interested in the Funds of the Society. The objection usually urged against a Society founded upon this principle, is the risk attendant on its failure, from an unexpected mortality amongst the Members, in an early period of its existence. No such objection, however, can apply to a Society such as the Scottish Widows' Fund, which has been in existence upwards of thirty -five rears — having realised and accumulated a CAPITAL of upwards of TWO MILLIONS THREE HUNDKED THOUSAND POUNDS, and possessing upwards of 6000 Members. The affairs of this Society are carefully scrutinized and examined, and its Funds and Liabilities are valued at stated intervals of seven years; the Profits ascertained at these periodical investigations are divided, and appropriated exclusively for the benefit of the assured — not less than one-third being retained as a Guarantee Fund, to maintain the stability of the Institution till the succeeding period of investigation, when it falls to be included in the amount to be then divided in like manner, and the remainder being divided amongst the Members entitled to participate in them. . The share of the Profits falling to each Member may be applied by him in any of the following ways : — It may be taken as an addition to the original sum assured ; or it may be surrendered for its present value in cash ; or this value may be applied towards the reduction of the future Premiums. The following Table will exemplify the Additions already made to this Society's Policies :— TABLE OP BONUS ADDITIONS Under a Policy for £500. Thus, if a Policy for £500, opened in the year 1819, were emerging after payment of the Premium due in the year 1851, the representatives of the party would receive the sum of £1013 : : 7, or MORE THAN DOUBLE THE ORIGINAL ASSURANCE. Burreiide The folio-wing case, taken from the Society's books, will exemplify the effect of the additions, when endered or applied towards the reduction of the future animal Premiums :— CASE. On the 18th May 1818, a gentleman, being in his twenty-seventh year, assured the sum of £1000, feayine an annual Premium of £23 : 18 : 3. This gentleman died in January 1849, and his represent*- tires received in addition to the original Insurance of £1000, a bonus of £91 i : 19 : 10, making the total sum paid under the Policy £1917 : 19 : 10. Had this Member died in the present year (after payment of the Premium) his representatives would have received the sum of £2026 : 11 : 2, or more that* double the original amount contained in the Policy. Had this Member desired, in the year previous to his death to surrender the vested additions, the sum of £433 : 17 : 1 would have been allowed to him as their then value : or had he desired to apply them towards reducing the future Premium, not only might the Premium of £23 : 18 : 3 hare been entirely extinguished, but he would have received in addition either a sum of £169 :16 : 7 in cash, or a Bonus of £316 : 16 : 11 might have been allowed to remain attached to the Policy— he still reserving his right to all future additions.

The Rates of Premium have been calculated expressly for it, aud will hear a fair comparison with those of other Companies. No Entry-Money is Charged. Tatties may assure either a specific sum, pay- able at death, on payment of a reduced rate of premium ; or, on payment of an increased rate, they may participate in the Profit Scheme of the Company. III. DISTRIBUTION OF PROFITS. Two-Thirds of the Profits arising on the Participating Class of Policies, without being eubject to any charges for Management , are divided every five years among those entitled to participate, on the most equitable principle, viz., in the proportion each party has contributed to the Fund. At the Second Investigation of the Profit Fund for the Five Years preceding 1st August 1846, the Directors were enabled to declare a Bonus, averaging about one and three-quarters per cent per annum on the original sums insured.

THIS Institution, -which combines every advantage of a Scotch and English Office, while it hope9 to receive the especial Patronage of Episcopalians, rests its claims to the support of the Public generally on the sound and equitable principles of its scheme. It combines the Mutual or Participating, with the Proprietary or Non-participating System of Assurance. In the former, the Assured are entitled to Four-Fifths of the Accumulated Profits. In the latter, they are charged the lowest Rates of Premium consistent with security to the Establishment. In both branches the Policy-holders are fully protected by the large Proprietary Capital of the Company, subscribed by a numerous and influential body of Shareholders. The remarkable success of the Institution will be evident from the result of the recent Division of Profits, when a BONUS of FIFTY-SIX per Cent on the Premiums paid was declared, — or an equiva- lent Reduction varying from TWENTY-FIVE to FORTY per Cent on the Premiums payable during the ensuing fire years. FIEE ASSURANCE. Premiums of Assurance against Fire are charged at the usual moderate rates, with a Reduction of £10 per Cent on the Residences and Furniture of Clergymen of all denominations, and the Buildings and contents of Churches and Church Schools. LOANS. The Company are now prepared to Advance Money to Clergymen upon the security of Life Policies effected with tliis Institution, upon peculiarly liberal and advantageous terms. WILLIAM F.

The Divisions of Profits, which heretofore have been made Septennially, will in future be made Quinquennially, the first of such Divisions to be declared in June 1855, when all Participating Policies, which shall have subsisted at least one year at Christmas 1854, will be allowed to share in the Profits., At the several past Divisions of Profits made by this Company, the Reversionary Bonuses added to. the Policies from One-half the Profits, amounted, on an average of the different Ages, to about 1 Per Cent Per Annum on the Sums Insured, and the total Bonuses added at the four Septennial Divisions exceeded .£770,000. FOREIGN RISKS. The Extra Premiums required for the East and West Indies, the British Colonies, and the northern parts of the United States of America, have been materially reduced. LOANS Granted on Life Policies to the extent of their values, provided such Policies shall have been effected a sufficient time to have attained in each case a value not under £50. No additional Premium will be required from Mihtary men, unless when called into actual sendee. No charge will be made for Entrance-Money, Admission Eees, or for Policies beyond the cost of the Stamp. AGENTS. Aberdeen Mr Alex. Chivas. Glasgow. ..Mr William Perry. Dundee Mr John Anderson.

MEDICAL REFEREES REMUNERATED. PERCY M. DOVE, Manager. EXTRACT FROM THE " Post Magazine." " The Annual Report of the Royal Insurance Company, at Liverpool, and a commentary upon it in the Post Maga- zine, have become as regularly conjoined as the Queen's speech on the opening of Parliament, and the debate by which it is invariably followed. The Managers of other Offices cannot charge us with partiality in these annual notices, as the success of the Royal Insurance Company has been of so remarkable a nature as almost to give it a separate position from Assurance Societies of recent date. " In analyzing the Report read at the recent meeting, and comparing its details with those of former years, we find that the amount received for Fire Premiums in the year 1849 is £34,469 : 10 : 4; being about £2,200 more than the receipts in 1846 — rather more than the amount received in 1847— and more than £3,000 above the receipts of 1848. The entire receipts, under this head, from the opening of the Office, in June 1845, to 31st Dec. 1848, stand as follows :— . "June, 1845, to Dec. 31, 1846 £54,128 19 "Jan. 1, 1847, to Dec. 31, 1847 34,187 5 5 "Jan. 1, 1848, to Dee. 31, 1848 31,346 1 9 "£119,662 6 2 forming a grand total of nearly £120,000." EXTRACT FROM THE " Report." (Life Branch.) " The position of the Life Branch of the Company is such as to give full satisfaction. " One Life only has dropped during the course of the past year, and since its close small claims have become payable on the deaths of two others. The total number of deaths, therefore, in five years, has been but four ; whilst, if the aver- age age of the lives insured by the Company be taken, and a computation be made, founded on the mortality known to prevail among insured lives, it would appear that the deaths in that period of time should have been no less than ten. " Taking, therefore, the important test which the quality of the lives selected by tha Company gives, the Proprietor may hope that this department will, in future years, become the means of adding an increased permanent value to his property, while the life assurer, in addition to his consciousness of perfect security, may indulge the expectation ot an important ultimate benefit to his policy in the shape of a rapidly-accruing profit, which the continuance of a minimum rate of mortality would insure."

THE SCOTTISH PROVIDENT INSTITUTION is the only Office which combines the advantage of Mutual Assurance and Participation in the Whole Profits with Moderate Premiums. The Assured are at the same time specially exempt from personal liability. The PREMIUMS are, at early and middle ages, about a fourth lower than in other Mutual Offices ; so that the sum required by them, say at age 30, for £1000, woidd secure a Policy for £1230. In many Offices Assurers are offered the choice of a Moderate Scale of Premiums, without any claim to share in the Profits, or of a right to participate in these, at an excessive rate of Premium. Assurers with the Scottish Provident Institution are the sole recipients of the Profits, and at rates of Premium equally moderate with the Non-participatinrj scale of the Proprietary Companies. The WHOLE PROFITS belong to the Assured themselves, and the principle on which they are divisible is at once safe, equitable, aud favourable to good lives. The Surplus, in place of being frittered away among Policies that have subsisted only a few years (and on which there must be a loss, and not a profit), is reserved for those members who alone have made surplus payments; in other words, for those whose Premiums with accumulated interest amount to the sums in their Policies. These members sharing along with a comparatively small number, and not, as is usual, in common with the great body of the contributors, may reasonably anticipate very considerable additions, not- withstanding the lowness of the Premiums. The shares will be given, at the option of the members, either in addition to the Policies or in abatement or extinction of the future Premiums. no entry-money. EXAMPLES OF ANNUAL PREMIUM FOR ASSURANCE OF £100 AT DEATH. (By both Scales the Assured are entitled to share in the whole Profits.) By the fust of these scales, a person of the age of 30 may secure £100 at death, 1 for a yearly payment, daring Ms life, of £2 : 1 : 6 only. By the second, he may se use the same sum at death, for a yearly pre- mium of £2 : 14 : 6, ceasing cm his attaining the age of ~0 — being thus entirely relieved of payment before he has passed the prime of life, and that for nearly the same premium m other Mutual Offices require for the whole of life. ■.!/«?/ 1851.

THIS Society is founded on the Equitable Principle of MUTUAL ASSURANCE, and transacts every description of Assurance and Annuity Business on principles the most liberal. The WHOLE PROFITS of the Office ARE DIVIDED AMONGST THE MEMBERS INSURED FOR LIFE, and IMPORTANT ADDITIONS to the Sums Insured may be con- fidently anticipated at the Periodical Division in 1852. NO ENTRANCE-MONEY of any description is demanded, and LOANS are granted on approved security, Heritable and Per- sonal, in connexion with Assurances ; and upon Policies of acquired value Liberal Ad- vances are made.

THIS Corporation transacts almost every kind of Life Assurance, Annuity, Endowment, Investment^ and EEVERSiONARr Business. Life Assurances may be effected with, or without Participation in Profits, on approved lives, for capital sums from £20 upwards, payable at death or at any specified age. The Company's LIFE ASSUKANCE business is divided into two distinct branches : — 1. The Non- Participation Class, in which the Assured receive no addition to their Policies, the premiums being calculated on the lowest scale consistent with perfect safety ; and, 2. The Participation Class, in which the whole profits belong to the Assured, and are divided every five years among the surviving members. The business of this Branch is conducted by the Proprietors (who also guarantee the sums assured) for a commission of 10 per cent on the amount of premiums received. This is the most explicit mode of dealing with the Assured which has yet been adopted, and is the Distinctive Feature of the Northern Assur- ance Company. Every advantage of the Mutual Assurance System is secured, without its attendant risks and liabilities. Not only are the Assured free from responsibility, but the Capital Stock and body of Pro- prietors which form their security render unnecessary the reservation of a Guarantee fund to provide for contingencies, thus enabling the Assured to receive a larger proportion of profits than they could in a Mutual Society. Annual Premium for the Assurance of £100, Payable at Death. The Premiums may be paid Yearly, Half -Yearly, or Quarterly, for a limited number of yeart only, or by a single payment. No Entry-Money charged. Undertaken on similar terms with other respectable Offices. N.B. — No charge is made for Policy Stamp when the sum Insured amounts to £200, or on Transfers from other Offices. Tables of the Company's Rates, Forms of Proposal, and all other information, may be obtained by ap- plication at the Head Offices or Agencies. Wm. CHALMERS, General Manager. Wm.

THE SECiOND Division of Profits was declared on 23d Jmie 1S47, for the five years ending 3lst De- cember 1846. The Reversionary Bonus averaged £8 : 13 : 5 per Cent on the sums assured, or 53£ per Cent on the Premiums received during the preceding five years. The equivalent reduc- tion on the Premiums payable until the next Division of Profits averaged 31$ per Cent. The Third Quinquennial Division will be made in June 1852. A Distinguishing feature of this Company is — a guaranteed return at any time for the surrender of existing Whole-Term Policies, effected by even rates, of forty per CENT of the amount of Premiums received. The objection often raised by persons intending to assure, as to the uncertainty of being aide to continue the payment of their Premiums, is thus obviated, and a Policy-holder will always knoio the value of his Policy. Policies will also thus be rendered immediately available as securities. Among the other advantages of the Company are the following:^- Four-fifths of the Profits, or 80 ter cent, given every Five years to the Assured by the partici- pation scale. A person desirous of surrendering his Policy may receive, instead of a payment in Cash, a new Policy for an equivalent sum, not subject to further payment of Premium.</page><page objectIdentifierValue="83077134" pageOrder="441">INSURANCE DIRECTORY. tfvii [Tk$ Minerva Life Assurance Company — contained.'] Credit given for one-third of the Premiums upon whole-term Policies.

WHOLE-WORLD POLICIES, WITH EXEMPTION FROM EXTRA PAYMENTS. The Directors, considering the restrictions to which persons assuring have hitherto been subject, and the daily increasing intercourse between the United Kingdom and its Colonics, as well as other parts of the world, have instructed their Actuary to prepare Tables for Deferred Assurances upon the Lives of Children, to become payable at death after the attainment of the age of Twenty-one years; combining with such Assurances liberty to proceed to and reside in any part of the "World, without special permission, and without any extra charge ; and have now the pleasure to submit the follow- ing low rates for Endowment or Deferred Assurances, with such privileges.

For instance: — A young man whose father shall have effected an Assurance on his life for £1000 at the age of Five years, will find himself, at the age of Twenty-one, in the possession of an unrestricted Policy, liable to the annual payment of only £9 : 13 : 4, instead of the usual charge of £19 : 17 :0, and without being subjected to the restraints hitherto prescribed by Life Offices generally. In case of surrender, a guaranteed return of 40 per Cent of the Premiums received will be made ; but where the Life assured is under Twenty-one years of age, evidence of good health will .be required.

PROGRESS OF THE BUSINESS DURING THE YEAR 1850. 891 New Policies were issued by the Company during the year ending 15th November 1850 — 861 for Assurances, and 30 for other transactions. The New Assurances during the period amounted to £509,147, 10s. 6d., yielding New Premiums to the amount of £17,550, 14s. 9d. The Number of Proposals made to the Company during the period was 1066, of which 861 were accepted, and 205 declined — the whole sum proposed for Assurance being £621,943, 14s. 2d. A very Large Addition was made to the Funds of the Company, and the Directors are en- abled to maintain a high rate of interest on their Investments, which are almost entirely seemed on Land or on Government Securities. PROGRESS OF THE BUSINESS DURING THE FIVE YEARS 1845 TO 1850. The number of Proposals for Assurance made to the Company during the last five years was 4360, for Assurances to the amount of £2,737,925, 4s. 5d. Of this number, 3436 Proposals for Assurances to the amount of £2,146,641, 12s. 9d. were ac- cepted ; and 924 for Assurances to the Amount of £581,283. lis. 8d., declined. The New Premiums on business transacted during the period amounted, on an average, to about £14,700 per annum, or £73,480, 13s. in all of New Premiums, from 1845 to 1850. The actual Expenses of conducting the business have not increased during the period, and are consequently a much smaller per centage on the revenue than in 1815. The Revenue of the Company is £169,151, 16s. 4d. per annum. [Continued.</page><page objectIdentifierValue="83077182" pageOrder="445">INSURANCE DIRECTORY.

The following Table shews the additions made to Policies at the periods of Division in the years above mentioned: — Additions to Policies are vested when tlie Policies have been in existence for Five Years from the date of the risk commencing. The following- new and important features in the practice of Life Assurance were adopted at a General Meeting of the Company, held 10th April 1851: — RESOLUTIONS, 10th APRIL 1851. SELECT ASSURANCES. The Directors of the Standard Life Assurance Company are satisfied that there is a time when so important a contract as a Life Assurance Policy ought to become " unchallengeable." They are also satisfied that the condition of the Company's Policies restricting residence within the limits of Europe is unnecessary in the great mass of Assurance transactions, and, with the purpose of giving to the assured the benefit of these views, have passed the following RESOLUTIONS. I. That Two Classes of Select Assurances shall be opened by the Company. The Policies of parties admitted to the "First Class of Select Assurances," and who shall continue to pay the premiums falling due upon these policies regularly, shall be un- challengeable upon any ground whatever, and the Assured may, without for- feiting these Policies, or payment of extra Premiums, reside or travel in any part of the world. The Policies of Parties admitted to the " Second Class of Select Assurances" shall be sub- ject to the existing Conditions of the Company as to residing or travelling beyond the limits of Europe, and as to Military or Naval Service ; but, with these exceptions, where the Premiums are regularly paid, shall also be absolutely unchallengeable. II. That Parties who hold Policies with the Company of Jive years' 1 duration shall be admissible to these Classes, and that this privilege shall extend to existing as well as future Assu- rances. III. That no expense shall attend admission to either Class of Select Assurances. IV. That admission to these Classes, First or Second, shall depend on the circumstances of each case, to be judged of by the Directors, and that a special application be made to the Board of Directors accordingly. V. That, on the application being granted, a certificate of admission shall be given under the hands of three of the Directors. Every other information regarding the Company may be had at their 0fiice8 in Edinburgh, Lon- don, Dublin, and Glasgow, or at any of the Agencies. WILL. THOS. THOMSON, Manager.

Under the former, about 84 per cent of the whole profits are divided among the Insured. The Non-Participation Rates of the Company, compared with the Rates of the Mutual ones, give, at the age of 30, an annual return of £5, 14s. on an Insurance of £1200 ; or, in other words, an Insurance of £1475 may be effected with this Company for the same Premium that an Insurance of £1200 would cost with the Mutual Companies at that age, exclusive of 10s. per cent of entry -money, which this Company does not charge. Parties Insured with other Companies which do not declare their Bonuses for one or two years to come, may have these secured to them by an Insurance with tins Company at a moderate rate.

THE Assured in this Society enjoy during their own lives the Surplus or Profits arising on the busi- ness. The divisible Surplus is ascertained every year, and is paid over in money to the Assured at the settlement of their next Annual Premiums. By this system Life Assurances are obtained at the lowest expense consistent with security. In 1S45, 184G, and 1847, the surplus thus repaid to the members amounted to 30 per cent of their Premiums, that is, 6s. per £1. They were, therefore, required to pay only 14s. per £1 of their Premiums in each of these years. In 1848, 1849, and 1850, the surplus repaid amounted to 35 per- cent of the Premiums, that is, 7s. per £1 ; and the members had, therefore, to pay only 13s. per £1 in these years. For example : — A member whose annual Premium is £10, has, this year, paid only £6, 5s., and another member whose annual Premium is £25, has paid only £16, 5s. The following are specimens of the Premiums payable in the present year by members of five years' standing : — *** This mode of dividing the Surplus or Profits has been adopted by no other Assurance Office in Scotland. During the last three years alone, upwards of Two Thousand individuals have joined the In- stitution—assuring their lives for sums varying from £50 to £5000. The Society have Agents in most of the Towns in England and Scotland. Prospectuses will be sent, post-paid-, to any part of the Kingdom ; and parties residing in Districts where there are no Agents of the Soaeti/, may readily effect Assurances by communicating with the Manager at the Head Office.</page><page objectIdentifierValue="83077218" pageOrder="448">XXIV INSURANCE DIRECTORY.

PROGRESS OF THE BUSINESS. The Board of Directors in Scotland refer with much gratification to the increasing prosperity of the Association, and to the large amount of business transacted during the past year, as affording unquestionable evidence of public favour and confidence. The New Assurances effected during the year 1850 considerably exceeded the sum of Two Hundred Thousand Pounds, producing in New Premiums upwards of Nine Thousand Pounds; — the Annual Income, during the same period, exclusive of Annuity Purchase-Money, amounted to Fifty-Two Thou- sand Three Hundred Pounds, — the Funds Invested, to'upwards of a Quarter of a Million, — and the Sub- sisting Assurances, to One Million One Hundred and Eighty Thousand Pounds. THE POLICIES of the Association are effectually secured by a protecting CAPITAL of ONE MILLION STERLING, fully subscribed by a numerous and wealthy body of Proprietors, and thus present a most advantageous mode of Investment for Family Provision, with entire exemption from responsibility. THE PREMIUMS may be paid Yearly, Half- Yearly, Quarterly, for a limited Term of Years, or in a Single Payment — at the option of the Assured. THE PROFITS are divided at each Investigation, according to an approved and equitable system of division, whereby sub- stantial justice is secured to all the Assured, without any unfair preference being given to the earlier Entrants, either by an indefinite postponement of the period of Investigation — by drawing back at each Division to the date of the Original Assurance — or by any other modification of the Tontine principle, as opposed to that of pure Life Assurance, whereby the interests of New Entrants are exposed to an unequal and disadvantageous competition with those of the Older Members. The Bonus additions vest immediately on declaration ; and they may be appropriated in any of the following ways : — I. Asa PERMANENT ADDITION to the Sum assured by the Policy. II. In Reduction of THE FUTURE PREMIUMS payable voider the Policy. HI. By an Immediate CASH-PA YMENT of the present value of the Bonus.

THE FIRST INVESTIGATION took place at Christmas 1846, when a REVERSIONARY BONUS OF TWO PER CENT PER ANNUM, vesting immediately on declaration, was added to all Policies entitled to participate in the Division. Specimens of Bonus Additions at Christmas 1846. THE SECOND INVESTIGATION and Division of Profits will take place at Christmas 1853. HALF-CREDIT PREMIUMS. Persons who may find it inconvenient to pay the full Annual Premium at first, may effect Assurances for the Whole Term of Life on the Half-Credit Scale, whereby one-half of the Annual Premiums may remain unpaid for Three, Five, or Seven years — the arrears being either paid up at the end of the period, or allowed to remain as a permanent debt against the Policy, in the option of the Assured. Such Policies receive the full advantage of Bonus Additions on the Whole Sum Assured, the value of which, when declared, may, if desired, be applied towards extinction of the arrears of Premium. They also afford this important advantage, that Assurances may thus be effected at an earlier age, and consequently at a much lower rate of Premium, than if postponed until the party is enabled to pay the full amount of the Annual Premium. No Entry-Money is charged. Non-Participation Policies on a Reduced Scale op Premiums. Single Payment, or Deposit Assurances on favourable terms. Annuities, Immediate and Deferred, and Endowments.

THE above School has been established expressly with the view of affording to a limited number of Pupils an education equal in all respects, and, it is hoped, superior in some, to that of the Public Schools of England ; nor has any care or expense been spared to secure the attainment of this object. Pupils destined for the Universities are trained thoroughly in Classics and Mathe- matics, while the education of others is considerably modified with a view to their future career in life, especial attention being paid to the preparation of Pupils for the Army. The study of English Composition occupies a prominent place in the general course, and is taught in all the Classes by the Head Master. Dr Humphreys is a Member of the Church of England, but he has arranged with Ministers of other Churches to give instruction, when required, to Pupils of their respective Communions in Doctrinal Beligion. The entire system of the School has been arranged with a due regard to each of the three great elements of sound education, so that, while the Intellectual holds its just posi- tion, the Moral and the Physical are also carefully attended to. Plots of Flower-Garden, and Rabbit-Houses, are allotted to such of the Pupils as desire them. The Pupils are constantly under the superintendence of the Masters, and every means has been adopted for the promotion of comfort and health, the Establishment being sup- plied with Hot, Cold, and Shower-Baths, and with patent Ventilators in the Rooms. VACATIONS: Three Weeks at Christmas, Ten Bays at Easter, and Six Weeks at Midsummer.
